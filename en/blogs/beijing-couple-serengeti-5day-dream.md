## Preface: From "Animal World" to Real Wilderness

As office workers in Beijing working 9-to-5, my husband Li Yue and I always dreamed of one day seeing the scenes from "Animal World" with our own eyes. After getting married, we decided to make this dream come true on our honeymoon—go to Tanzania, go to the Serengeti, see real Africa.

We chose Balbina Safari's [**Classic Northern Circuit 5-Day**]({{ site.baseurl }}/packages/classic-northern-5day), and it proved to be one of the best decisions we've ever made.

## Day 1: First Sight of Africa - Tarangire's Shock

### 🌅 Morning Arrival

On September 15 at dawn, our plane landed at Kilimanjaro International Airport (JRO). Stepping out of the cabin, the African heat hit my face, carrying a scent I'd never smelled before—dry, earthy, with a faint grass fragrance.

Balbina Safari's driver and guide **Moses** was already waiting at the exit holding a sign. He's a smiling Maasai man, fluent English with a unique accent. The vehicle was a customized Land Cruiser with a fully openable roof, each seat by the window—crucial for photography!

### 🐘 First Close Encounter with Elephants

From the airport to [Tarangire National Park]({{ site.baseurl }}/destinations/tarangire) was about 2.5 hours drive. Moses explained Tanzanian history and culture along the way, and even taught us some Swahili:
- *Jambo* (Hello)
- *Asante* (Thank you)
- *Hakuna Matata* (No problem, really just like in "The Lion King!")

Around 2 PM, we entered Tarangire. Less than 5 minutes into the park, Moses stopped and pointed ahead: "Look, elephants!"

I'll never forget that moment.

A family of about 30 elephants was slowly crossing the road. Leading was an older female elephant (Moses said this was the herd's "matriarch" leader), followed by members of different ages, the smallest baby elephant looking only months old, stumbling along clutching its mother's tail with its little trunk.

They were less than 10 meters from our vehicle.

I held my breath and pressed the shutter. In that moment, all fatigue, jet lag, discomfort from the long flight disappeared. **This is why I came to Africa.**

### 🌳 Giant Baobab Trees

Tarangire's most iconic feature is the giant baobab trees. Moses stopped under a particularly large one and told us this tree might be over 1000 years old.

"Maasai people believe baobab trees were planted upside down by God when creating the world, so their roots grow on top like the crown."

I looked at the tree, imagining how many centuries of sunrises and sunsets it had witnessed, how many generations of elephants cooled in its shade. Suddenly felt humans are really small.

### 🦁 Sunset Surprise

At 6 PM, Moses took us to a viewpoint to watch the sunset. Just as the sun was about to reach the horizon, he suddenly whispered: "Don't move. Lion."

Following his finger, I saw on a rock (Kopje) not far away, lay a male lion. He was sideways facing the sunset, his giant mane dyed golden, yawning leisurely.

**This day alone was worth the ticket price.**

## Day 2: Entering Serengeti - The Call of "Endless Plains"

### 🚗 Crossing Ngorongoro Highlands

Departed at 9 AM for Serengeti. Although the road was bumpy, the scenery was breathtaking. We crossed the Ngorongoro Conservation Area highlands, elevation gradually rising, temperature dropping.

Moses stopped by the roadside and pointed into the distance: "There's the crater rim, we'll go down tomorrow."

I saw through the clouds and mist, the crater's outline faintly visible, like a mysterious giant bowl.

### 🦓 The Moment Entering Serengeti

At 2 PM, we passed through Naabi Hill Gate, officially entering [Serengeti National Park]({{ site.baseurl }}/destinations/serengeti).

A sign by the park entrance read: "Serengeti - Endless Plains."

Driving past the gate, the view suddenly opened up—golden grassland extending to the horizon without end. Hundreds of zebras and wildebeest scattered across the landscape, like black and white stars.

My husband was too excited to speak, just kept pressing the shutter.

### 🐆 Cheetah! My First Time!

During the afternoon game drive, we saw our first cheetah in the wild.

It stood on a flat rock, black "tear marks" clearly visible, scanning the savanna. Moses explained cheetahs usually hunt at dusk, it might be looking for a stray gazelle.

We held our breath for about 20 minutes. Although it didn't attack (probably too far away), seeing a cheetah in the wild was extremely lucky—Moses said compared to lions and leopards, cheetahs are actually harder to find.

### 🏨 Four Seasons' "Elephant Pool"

When we arrived at [Four Seasons Safari Lodge]({{ site.baseurl }}/hotels/four-seasons) in the evening, we were exhausted. But walking into the room and seeing the view outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, all fatigue disappeared.

Outside was the hotel's famous "elephant pool"—a Water Hole with 7-8 elephants slowly drinking. The butler told us elephants come almost every evening, sometimes even lions.

At night, we had dinner on the hotel terrace, watching the starry sky (never seen so many stars!), listening to distant lion roars and hyena laughter.

**This is a real African night.**

## Day 3: Serengeti Full Day Game Drive - Most Unforgettable Day

### 🌅 5 AM Magic Moment

Moses suggested we join the morning game drive. Although we had to get up at 5 AM, it was absolutely worth it.

Early morning Serengeti is another world. Morning mist covered the grassland, acacia tree silhouettes on the horizon like paper cutouts. Temperature was very low, I wore a thick jacket and was still shivering, but my heart was warm.

Just before sunrise (photographers call this the "blue hour"), we encountered a lion pride.

8 lions, just finished night hunting, resting together. One male lion stood up, roaring at the rising sun, the sound deafening.

**In that moment, I finally understood what "King of Beasts" means.**

### 🍽️ Bush Lunch - White Tablecloth on the Savanna

At noon, Moses took us to a giant acacia tree. Two staff had already set up a table there—really white tablecloth, silverware, flowers!

This is the so-called [Bush Lunch]({{ site.baseurl }}/services/bush-lunch).

In the middle of the savanna, surrounded by grazing zebras, we enjoyed freshly grilled chicken, pasta salad, and champagne. After lunch, staff even brought out coffee and dessert.

My husband joked: "More romantic than Beijing's Michelin restaurants."

### 🦏 Leopard on Kopjes

In the afternoon, Moses took us to a Kopjes area. These granite outcrops rising from the ground are favorite spots for lions and leopards—both observation platforms and shade.

Scanning with binoculars for about half an hour, Moses suddenly exclaimed: "Leopard! On that rock!"

I saw on top of a large rock, a leopard lazily lying, tail hanging outside the rock, swinging leisurely.

Leopards are the hardest of the "Big 5" (African Big Five) to see because they're very secretive. Moses said even experienced guides sometimes don't see a leopard for a week.

**We were really lucky.**

## Day 4: Ngorongoro Crater - "African Eden"

### 🌋 Descending to Crater Floor

Today was the trip's climax—[Ngorongoro Crater]({{ site.baseurl }}/destinations/ngorongoro).

At 6 AM, we started descending from the crater rim. The road was very steep, zigzagging, 600-meter vertical drop, about 30 minutes of winding road.

At the bottom, the sight left me speechless:

A giant "bowl" 20 kilometers in diameter, surrounded by 2000-meter-high crater walls. Inside were emerald grassland, blue lakes, herds of animals... This is why it's called "African Eden."

### 🦏 Searching for Black Rhinos

Ngorongoro is one of the few places in Tanzania where you can see endangered black rhinos. Moses said about 30 black rhinos live in the crater.

We searched with binoculars for about an hour, finally finding a gray giant by distant bushes.

Although far away, through binoculars we could clearly see its iconic two horns and massive size. Moses said this might be an adult male, weighing 1.5 tons.

Looking at this creature that has survived on Earth for millions of years, now on the verge of extinction, I felt mixed emotions.

### 🦛 Hippo Pool Symphony

At noon, we ate our [lunch box]({{ site.baseurl }}/services/lunch-box) at a designated picnic spot. Nearby was the famous "hippo pool."

Dozens of hippos squeezed into a mud pool, constantly yawning, roaring, pushing each other. The sound... like low engine rumbling mixed with burping, full of comedy effect.

Moses warned us not to get too close: "Hippos are among Africa's most dangerous animals, they kill more people annually than lions."

## Day 5: Goodbye, Africa

Final morning, we did a few more hours of game drive in the crater, then reluctantly left, driving back to Arusha.

In the car, I flipped through the 2000+ photos from these days, each one a story, each moment etched in my heart.

## 💡 Practical Tips & Experience Sharing

### About Cost
We chose a mid-range package, **$2,800 per person** (based on 2 people). This price includes:
- All park entrance fees (this is the big one, Tarangire + Serengeti + Ngorongoro tickets total over $300/person)
- 4 nights accommodation (Treetops, Four Seasons, Crater Lodge level)
- All meals
- Safari vehicle and guide
- Airport transfers

**Not included**:
- International flights (we flew from Beijing, about ¥7000/person, booked 2 months ahead)
- Visa ($50, visa on arrival available)
- Tips (gave Moses $120, 5 days total)
- Personal expenses (bought some souvenirs, about $150)

**Total cost**: About ¥35,000/person (including international flights)

### About Gear

**Essential**:
- Binoculars! (Available in vehicle, but your own is better)
- Camera + telephoto lens (I brought 70-200mm, not long enough! Recommend at least 300mm)
- Sunscreen (SPF50+)
- Lip balm (really dry!)
- Hat and sunglasses
- Thick jacket (mornings and Ngorongoro really cold!)

**Optional**:
- Power bank (vehicle has USB ports, but better to have backup)
- Mosquito repellent (September was okay, rainy season needs more)
- Wet wipes (road is very dusty)

### About Best Time

We went in September, right during the great migration in the north (river crossing season just ended). Although we didn't see the crossing, animal density was still very high.

Moses said:
- **July-October**: Northern migration, might see river crossing (not guaranteed!)
- **January-March**: Southern calving season, can see thousands of baby wildebeest
- **June**: Mating season, very spectacular
- **Avoid March-May**: Heavy rainy season, muddy roads, some camps closed

### Advice for First-Time Safari

1. **Choose a reliable local operator**: Balbina Safari was very professional, Moses experienced (10+ years), fluent English, most importantly—he genuinely loves this work, not just completing tasks.

2. **Don't be too greedy**: 5 days is actually just right, any longer leads to aesthetic fatigue.

3. **Get up early!**: Best animal activity times are early morning (5-8am) and late afternoon (4-7pm). Those midday hours are too hot, animals hide away.

4. **Be patient**: Safari isn't a zoo, animals won't "perform." Sometimes waiting 1 hour to see a lion, but that surprise after waiting is more precious than seeing lions in a zoo 100 times.

5. **Listen to your guide**: Moses several times said "don't stand up" or "keep quiet," all for good reasons.

## Conclusion: Africa Changed Me

It's been two months since returning to Beijing, but I still think about Serengeti's sunrise, lion roars, elephants' leisurely pace every day.

This trip changed my understanding of "travel." **True travel isn't checking off attractions, but experiencing a completely different form of life, feeling your place in the universe.**

In Ngorongoro Crater, watching animals that have lived, hunted, reproduced there for hundreds of thousands of years, suddenly felt human troubles—work pressure, mortgage, promotion—all became less important.

My husband said this was the most worthy expenditure of his life.

I completely agree.

If you also dream of going to Africa, don't wait anymore. While your body is still young, while you still have dreams, **Just do it.**

*Asante sana, Tanzania!*
*Serengeti, we will definitely return.*
