## Introduction

Guys, listen to me! I just graduated college, spent my first month's salary entirely on Safari, but I don't regret it at all!

$680, yes, that's $680! I spent 3 days covering Tanzania's northern circuit. Saw lions, elephants, giraffes, and drank beer, bonfired, watched stars with backpackers from around the world at public camps.

This guide is for all young people like me—poor but wanting to see the world!

## Trip Highlights

### Day 1: Group Departure + Tarangire's Elephant Party

**7:00 AM - Group Meeting in Arusha**

I found a group tour on Hostel World—"Budget 3-day Northern Circuit, $680 per person, max 6 people."

Next morning early, I arrived at meeting point with my 50L backpack. My teammates were:
- Sarah: British girl, Gap Year traveling
- Marco: Italian guy, just quit his job
- Yuki: Japanese girl, solo traveling
- Tom & Lisa: American couple, honeymoon (budget version)

Our driver and guide was Ali, a super chill Tanzanian guy, spoke fast English, taught us Swahili.

"Jambo! Welcome to Tanzania!" Ali smiled, "Today we go to Tarangire, many elephants there!"

**10:00 AM - Enter Tarangire National Park**

Entrance fee $53/person, hurt so much! But Ali said: "Trust me, it's worth it."

Less than 5 minutes into the park, we saw our first elephant herd—at least 20, eating grass by the roadside!

I pulled out my second-hand Canon 600D (bought for $300),疯狂 pressing shutter. Sarah laughed: "Wang, you're so excited!"

**2:00 PM - Public Camp Lunch**

Ali took us to public camp for lunch. Tourists from around the world at the camp, everyone greeting each other, sharing snacks.

"Where are you from?" a German uncle asked me.
"China!" I said proudly.
"China! I love China!" he gave thumbs up.

In that moment, I felt the world is really small.

**5:00 PM - Sunset Under Baobab Tree**

Ali took us to watch sunset. Sun setting, golden light through baobab tree, elephant silhouettes moving slowly on horizon.

"This is free scenery," Ali smiled, "Best things are free."

**8:00 PM - Camp Bonfire**

We cooked ourselves at public camp. Tom and Lisa grilled meat, Yuki made salad, Marco cut fruit, Ali and I started fire.

In firelight, 6 young people from 6 countries, talking about our dreams.

"I want to travel the world," Sarah said.
"I want to open my own restaurant," Marco said.
"I want to become a photographer," I said.

Ali smiled: "You young people, having dreams is great."

### Day 2: Serengeti - Big 5 First Experience

**5:30 AM - Morning Game Drive**

Ali said: "Morning game drive is best time to see animals."

We got up at 5:30, departed at 6. Early morning Serengeti beautiful as a painting—golden morning light, mist, distant mountains.

Less than 1 hour, we saw lion pride! 7 lions, napping under acacia tree.

"Look at the male lion," Ali pointed, "He's king of the savanna."

I held my breath, recording this moment with camera. First time seeing lions in the wild!

**10:00 AM - Seronera Public Camp**

We arrived at Seronera public camp to rest. Camp had showers (cold water), toilets (fairly clean), kitchen (cook yourself).

Marco and I went for water, met a group of baboons on the way. They were mischievous, trying to grab our water bottles.

"Be careful!" Ali warned, "Baboons are smart!"

**2:00 PM - Searching for Cheetahs**

Ali said: "Let's go look for cheetahs. They're harder to find."

We drove searching for 2 hours, finally saw a cheetah on a rock—black "tear marks" clearly visible, scanning savanna.

"Cheetah is fastest animal on earth," Ali said, "It can run at 110 km/h!"

We waited 30 minutes, although it didn't hunt, seeing a cheetah was extremely lucky.

**7:00 PM - Camp Stargazing**

Nighttime Serengeti, starry sky breathtaking. Countless stars, Milky Way clearly visible.

"This is my favorite place," Ali said, "Here, you feel small."

We sat around bonfire, drinking cheap Tanzanian beer (TZS 2000/bottle, about $1), talking about life.

"You know?" Ali said, "When I was little, saw lions walking past our house every day. Now, they're getting fewer."

In that moment, I suddenly understood the meaning of wildlife conservation.

### Day 3: Ngorongoro - Final Shock

**7:00 AM - Descend to Crater**

Ngorongoro Crater entrance fee $71/person, another big expense! But Ali said: "This is Africa's most beautiful place."

We descended along zigzag road to crater floor. 600-meter vertical drop, 30 minutes of winding road.

At bottom, sight left me speechless—giant "bowl" 20km diameter, surrounded by 2000-meter-high crater walls, inside emerald grassland, blue lakes, herds of animals.

**10:00 AM - Searching for Black Rhinos**

Ali said: "Let's try to find black rhinos. They're very rare."

We searched with binoculars for 1 hour, finally found a gray giant by distant bushes.

Although far away, seeing endangered black rhino with own eyes was extremely lucky.

**1:00 PM - Crater Picnic**

We ate lunch at designated picnic spot. Beside was hippo pool, dozens of hippos squeezed together yawning, roaring.

"Don't get too close," Ali warned, "Hippos are dangerous!"

**4:00 PM - Return Trip**

Reluctantly left crater, drove back to Arusha.

In car, I flipped through photos from these 3 days—lions, elephants, cheetahs, black rhinos, giraffes, zebras, wildebeest... each a story.

**8:00 PM - Farewell Dinner**

We had farewell dinner at a local restaurant in Arusha. Ali said: "You did great! Saw 4 of Big 5 in 3 days!"

We raised glasses—with cheap Tanzanian beer, celebrating these 3 days of adventure, our friendship, Africa's magnificence.

### 💡 Tips

1. **Group tour is key**: Going to Safari alone is too expensive, group tour saves money. I found group info on Hostel World, Couchsurfing, Facebook Groups.

2. **Choose public camps**: Luxury camps $500+/night, public camps $20/night. Although conditions worse, you meet backpackers from around the world!

3. **Cook yourself**: Camps have kitchens, buying groceries and cooking yourself much cheaper than eating at restaurants. We 6 cooked together, under $5 per person per meal.

4. **Bring enough cash**: Many places don't accept credit cards, must bring enough USD cash.

5. **Learn to bargain**: When buying at local markets, must bargain! Usually can knock off 30-50%.

6. **Respect local culture**: Tanzanians friendly, but don't casually photograph, especially Maasai people.

7. **Keep open mind**: You'll meet people from around the world, communicate with them, you'll learn a lot.

8. **Safety first**: Camp has wildlife at night, don't go out alone, must follow guide.

## Summary & Recommendations

This 3-day budget Safari was one of most unforgettable experiences of my life.

$680, I saw lions, elephants, cheetahs, black rhinos, met friends from 5 countries, learned to cook African food, experienced camp life, saw most beautiful starry sky.

**Advice for Budget Travelers**:

1. **Don't fear being poor**: Little money can still enjoy Safari! Key is group tour, public camps, cook yourself.

2. **Be brave socially**: At public camps, actively communicate with others. You'll meet many interesting people, learn a lot.

3. **Stay optimistic**: Conditions might be tough—cold showers, hard beds, bumpy roads, but these become most beautiful memories.

4. **Cherish every moment**: Safari not every day, cherish every moment, every animal, every encounter.

5. **Record everything**: Write diary, take photos, record videos. These memories more precious than anything.

6. **Respect nature**: Don't litter, don't feed animals, don't destroy environment. We're just guests, this is their home.

7. **Come again**: I'm already planning to come back next time—this time 7-day in-depth trip!

**My Safari Philosophy**:

Safari isn't just seeing animals, it's experiencing a completely different lifestyle.

At camp, I learned to cook with strangers.
On savanna, I learned patience waiting.
Under starry sky, I learned humility.
Around bonfire, I learned sharing.

These experiences more precious than any luxury goods.

**Final Final**:

If you're like me—poor but wanting to see the world, don't hesitate! Safari isn't rich people's patent, young people's courage and curiosity more precious than any money.

$680, 3 days, life-changing experience.

What are you waiting for?

*Asante sana, Africa!*
*I'll definitely return—with more money and more friends!*

**P.S. If you meet a guide named Ali in Arusha, tell him Wang says "Jambo"!**
