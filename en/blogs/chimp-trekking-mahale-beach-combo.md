## Introduction

As a zoology PhD, my research focuses on primate behavior. I studied chimpanzees in Kibale Forest, Uganda for 3 years, mountain gorillas in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda for 2 years, but August 2025 in Mahale Mountains National Park still shocked me.

Mahale Mountains is Tanzania's most remote wilderness, accessible only by small plane. Home to one of world's largest wild chimpanzee populations—about 1000 chimpanzees, divided into 8 communities.

Tracking wild chimpanzees isn't watching zoo performances, it's truly entering their world, observing their most natural behaviors. When you see a chimpanzee using stone to crack nuts, or using stick to fish for termites, you realize—we have much more in common with them than we imagined.

## Trip Highlights

### Day 1: Arrive in Mahale - Lake Tanganyika's Blue Miracle

**9:00 AM - Small Plane Takes Off**

12-seat Cessna Caravan from Arusha to Mahale Mountains. Flight time about 2.5 hours, flying over Serengeti and Ruaha National Parks.

Pilot is Tanzanian, named Moses. He said: "Perfect weather today, you'll see Lake Tanganyika's blue miracle."

**11:30 AM - Land at Kigoma Airstrip**

Plane landed at Kigoma airstrip, then transferred by speedboat to Mahale Mountains National Park. Speedboat ride about 3 hours, enjoying Lake Tanganyika's scenery.

Lake Tanganyika is world's second-deepest freshwater lake, deepest point 1470 meters, water crystal clear, can see fish underwater.

**3:00 PM - Arrive at Greystoke Mahale Camp**

We checked into [Greystoke Mahale Camp]({{ site.baseurl }}/hotels/), Mahale's most luxurious camp, built on lakeside beach, all rooms thatched cottages facing Lake Tanganyika.

Camp manager is French, named Sophie. She smiled: "Welcome to paradise."

**5:00 PM - Lakeside Sunset**

We waited for sunset on lakeside beach. Sun setting, golden light on lake surface, distant Mahale Mountains like giant barrier.

"Lake Tanganyika is one of world's oldest lakes," Sophie said, "It's 9 million years old."

**7:00 PM - Camp Dinner**

Dinner was freshly grilled fish—freshwater fish from Lake Tanganyika, with fresh vegetables and rice.

"Tomorrow 7 AM departure, chimpanzee tracking," Sophie said, "Need long sleeves and pants, many mosquitoes and ticks in forest."

### Day 2: First Tracking - M Group's Social Moment

**7:00 AM - Start Tracking**

Our guide was John, tracker worked in Mahale Mountains 20 years. Can distinguish every chimpanzee's call, knows their location.

"Today we look for M Group," John said, "Community of 35 chimpanzees, leader named Mzee."

We started hiking through dense tropical rainforest. Mahale Mountains vegetation very dense, many giant trees covered with vines and moss.

**9:00 AM - First See Chimpanzees**

Hiked about 2 hours, John suddenly stopped, pointed ahead: "Listen!"

We heard chimpanzee calls from distance—"pant-hoot" calls, their communication method.

"They're over there!" John excitedly.

Continued 15 minutes, finally saw first chimpanzee—female chimpanzee, sitting on branch, grooming fur with fingers.

"This is Mama," John said, "M Group's oldest female, about 45 years old."

**10:00 AM - Chimpanzees' "Social Moment"**

We saw more chimpanzees—at least 15, active in trees, some eating, some playing, some grooming.

"Chimpanzees highly social animals," John explained, "They have complex social structure, with leaders, hierarchy, alliances."

We saw Mzee—M Group's male leader, strong adult male, much larger than other chimpanzees. Sitting on branch, vigilantly watching surroundings.

**11:00 AM - Chimpanzees Using Tools**

We saw young male chimpanzee using stone to crack nuts. Placed nut on flat stone, used another stone to crack.

"This is chimpanzees' most famous behavior—using tools," John said, "Jane Goodall first discovered this in Gombe."

I held breath, recording this precious moment with camera. Chimpanzee successfully cracked nut, ate kernel inside, then placed stone aside for next use.

**1:00 PM - Return to Camp**

Reluctantly left forest, returned to camp. Although only tracked 3 hours, already saw chimpanzees' most natural behaviors—social, grooming, tool use.

**3:00 PM - Lake Tanganyika Swimming**

Afternoon, we swam in Lake Tanganyika. Water crystal clear, temperature moderate, very comfortable.

"Lake Tanganyika's water from underground springs and rain," Sophie said, "One of world's cleanest lakes."

We swam, snorkeled, saw many beautiful fish—cichlids, catfish, bass.

**7:00 PM - Camp Lecture**

John gave lecture about chimpanzees. Talked about chimpanzee social structure, behavior patterns, conservation status.

"Mahale Mountains' chimpanzee population very precious," John said, "One of world's most endangered primates, fewer than 150,000 remain globally."

### Day 3: Second Tracking - Hunting Shock

**7:00 AM - Track Again**

Today we looked for another community—K Group, community of 28 chimpanzees.

"K Group famous for hunting," John said, "They often hunt monkeys, especially red colobus."

**9:00 AM - Tracking Starts**

Hiked 1.5 hours, finally found K Group. Active in forest, scattered in different trees.

**10:00 AM - Hunting Shock**

Suddenly, we heard chimpanzee screams—not "pant-hoot" calls, but sharper screams.

"They're hunting!" John whispered.

We saw group of chimpanzees chasing red colobus monkey. Monkey jumping between trees, trying to escape, but chimpanzees coordinated, surrounding from different directions.

Entire process less than 1 minute, chimpanzees caught monkey. Dragged it under tree, started sharing prey.

"This is chimpanzees' most shocking behavior," John said, "Only primates that hunt cooperatively."

I held breath, recording this cruel but magnificent scene. Not cruelty, this is natural selection.

**11:00 AM - Sharing Prey**

Chimpanzees shared prey—male leader first, then other males, finally females and cubs.

"Sharing prey important behavior in chimpanzee society," John explained, "Strengthens community cohesion."

**1:00 PM - Return to Camp**

Returned to camp, mixed emotions. Saw chimpanzees' most shocking behavior—hunting, but this made us understand natural selection more deeply.

**3:00 PM - Lakeside Meditation**

Afternoon, we meditated on lakeside beach. Lake Tanganyika's blue water, distant Mahale Mountains, dense tropical rainforest, all brought peace.

"This is Africa," John said, "Life, birth, hunting, escape, all happening simultaneously."

### Day 4: Final Tracking - Cubs' Learning

**7:00 AM - Final Tracking**

Final day, we looked for M Group again. John said: "Today focus on observing cubs' learning process."

**9:00 AM - Cubs' Learning**

We saw many cubs—at least 10, ages from months to years. Playing, learning, imitating adult chimpanzees.

"Cubs' learning process very critical," John explained, "They must learn survival skills in shortest time—hunting, foraging, social."

We saw cub imitating adult chimpanzee using stick to fish termites—inserted stick into termite mound, pulled out, licked termites off. Technique not skilled yet, but very serious.

**10:00 AM - Motherhood's Greatness**

We saw female chimpanzee caring for her cub—cub sleeping in her arms, she gently grooming cub's fur with fingers.

"Chimpanzee motherhood very great," John said, "Mother cares for cub at least 5 years, teaches survival skills."

**11:00 AM - Farewell**

Reluctantly said goodbye to chimpanzees, returned to camp. These 3 days of tracking made me rediscover primate intelligence and emotion.

**3:00 PM - Final Lake Tanganyika Swim**

Afternoon, final swim in Lake Tanganyika. Water crystal clear, temperature moderate, very comfortable.

"I'll miss this place," John said, "Mahale Mountains is my home."

**7:00 PM - Farewell Dinner**

Dinner was roasted whole lamb—lamb from local farm, with fresh vegetables and rice.

"Tomorrow you leave," Sophie said, "Hope you'll come back."

## Summary & Recommendations

This 3-day chimpanzee tracking journey made me rediscover primate intelligence and emotion.

I saw:
- Chimpanzee social behavior
- Chimpanzees using tools
- Chimpanzees cooperative hunting
- Cubs' learning process
- Motherhood's greatness

These scenes, some heartwarming, some cruel, some touching, some shocking. But all chimpanzees' most natural behaviors.

**Advice for Primate Enthusiasts**:

1. **Choose professional guide**: Good guide can find chimpanzees, predict their behavior, explain their actions.

2. **Bring right gear**: Telephoto lens must, at least 200mm. Binoculars let you see more clearly.

3. **Stay patient**: Tracking requires 2-4 hours hiking, stay patient, don't rush.

4. **Respect nature**: Don't disturb chimpanzees, don't destroy their habitats, don't use flash.

5. **Record everything**: Photograph, video, write diary, these records valuable for scientific research.

6. **Support conservation**: Chimpanzees endangered species, support conservation organizations, raise awareness.

**My Research Philosophy**:

Primate research isn't just observing behavior, it's understanding intelligence.

I research chimpanzees using tools, not to show cleverness, but to understand intelligence's origin.
I research chimpanzee social behavior, not to show complexity, but to understand society's origin.
I research chimpanzee hunting behavior, not to show cruelty, but to understand cooperation's origin.

Every observation is reflection on humanity itself.

**Why Mahale Mountains Special**:

- **Largest population**: Mahale Mountains has one of world's largest wild chimpanzee populations
- **Most natural behavior**: Chimpanzees here not domesticated, most natural behavior
- **Most beautiful scenery**: Lake Tanganyika's blue water, Mahale Mountains' dense forest
- **Most remote wilderness**: Accessible only by small plane, few tourists

**Final Final**:

Tracking wild chimpanzees isn't watching zoo performances, it's truly entering their world.

When you see chimpanzee using stone to crack nuts, you realize—we have much more in common with them than we imagined.

When you see chimpanzees cooperative hunting, you understand—cooperation is society's foundation.

When you see motherhood, you're moved—motherhood shared by all mammals.

This is primate charm.

*Happy Tracking!*
*May you understand our closest relatives.*
