## Introduction

As an "old traveler" with 15 years of mountaineering experience, I've climbed Everest North Face, Muztagh Ata, Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, Four Girls Mountain... But June 2025's Tanzania double peaks challenge still shocked me.

Mount Meru (4566m) + Kilimanjaro (5895m), 10 days, two peaks. This isn't ordinary mountaineering, it's a complete course on altitude acclimatization, physical management, and mental challenge.

Why climb Meru first then Kilimanjaro? How does this strategy improve summit success rate from 60% to 85%? This diary will give you the answer.

## Trip Highlights

### Day 1-4: Mount Meru - Perfect Altitude Acclimatization

**Day 1: Arrive in Arusha - Prepare to Depart**

At 10 AM, I arrived in Arusha. My climbing guide was Emmanuel, a Tanzanian with 20 years of mountaineering experience, successfully summited Kilimanjaro 200+ times.

"Welcome to Tanzania," Emmanuel smiled, "Tomorrow we go to Mount Meru."

Day 1 afternoon, I checked gear:
- Hiking boots (already broken in)
- Down jacket (-20°C)
- Hardshell jacket and pants (waterproof breathable)
- Thermal underwear (merino wool)
- Fleece jacket
- Quick-dry clothes
- Trekking poles (carbon fiber)
- Headlamp (spare batteries)
- Sunglasses (UV400 protection)
- Hats (warm hat + sun hat)
- Gloves (warm gloves + waterproof gloves)
- Water bottle (2L)
- Power bank

**Day 2: Momella Gate (1500m) → Miriakamba Hut (2500m)**

Departed at 8 AM from Momella Gate. Mount Meru park fee $50/person, much cheaper than Kilimanjaro.

Hiking time: 4-5 hours
Elevation gain: 1000 meters
Difficulty: Moderate

First half tropical rainforest, dense vegetation, many monkeys and birds. Second half bamboo forest, getting steeper.

At 1 PM, arrived at Miriakamba Hut (2500m). First camp on Mount Meru, simple huts and toilets.

"Today's elevation gain relatively gentle," Emmanuel said, "Tomorrow will be steeper."

At 7 PM, we had dinner—bean soup, rice, vegetables. Emmanuel measured my blood oxygen saturation: 95%, heart rate: 72 bpm, all normal.

**Day 3: Miriakamba Hut (2500m) → Saddle Hut (3500m)**

Departed at 7 AM, hiking time: 3-4 hours, elevation gain: 1000 meters, difficulty: moderate to hard.

Today's route steeper, vegetation changed from bamboo to alpine meadow. Saw many black-faced monkeys and blue monkeys.

At 12 PM, arrived at Saddle Hut (3500m). Second camp on Mount Meru, located on "saddle" between Meru main peak and little peak.

At 2 PM, Emmanuel suggested we climb little peak (3820m) as acclimatization training: "This helps your body adapt to higher altitude."

We climbed 2 hours, reached little peak summit. From here could see Meru main peak and distant Kilimanjaro.

"Tomorrow we depart at 2 AM, summit Meru main peak," Emmanuel said.

At 6 PM, we had dinner, then rested early. Blood oxygen saturation: 92%, heart rate: 78 bpm, started showing mild altitude sickness symptoms—slight headache, shortness of breath.

**Day 4: Summit Meru Main Peak (4566m) → Return to Arusha**

Got up at 2 AM, departed at 3 AM. Headlamp beams flickering in darkness, we climbed steep mountain path upward.

Hiking time: 5-6 hours
Elevation gain: 1066 meters
Difficulty: Hard

First half steep rock wall, needed hands and feet. Second half volcanic ash, every step slid down.

At 6 AM, reached Meru main peak (4566m). Sun just rising, golden light on crater, distant Kilimanjaro faintly visible in clouds and mist.

"Meru is Kilimanjaro's 'little sister'," Emmanuel said, "Although shorter, steeper, harder to climb."

We stayed 30 minutes at summit, took photos, rested, replenished energy.

At 7 AM, started descent. Descent harder than climbing, volcanic ash made every step like skiing.

At 12 PM, arrived at Saddle Hut, had lunch.

At 2 PM, continued descent to Miriakamba Hut.

At 5 PM, arrived at Miriakamba Hut, then continued descent to Momella Gate.

At 7 PM, returned to Arusha.

Blood oxygen saturation: 90%, heart rate: 80 bpm, mild altitude sickness symptoms, but controllable.

### Day 5-10: Kilimanjaro - Roof of Africa

**Day 5: Arusha - Rest Day**

Today was rest day, Emmanuel said: "Rest important, let your body recover."

I rested at Arusha hotel, adjusted gear, replenished energy.

Blood oxygen saturation: 98%, heart rate: 70 bpm, fully recovered.

**Day 6: Machame Gate (1800m) → Machame Camp (3000m)**

Departed at 8 AM from Machame Gate. Kilimanjaro park fee $100/person, much more expensive than Mount Meru.

Hiking time: 5-7 hours

We climbed 2 hours, reached Shira Cathedral. From here could see Kilimanjaro's three volcanic peaks—Kibo, Mawenzi, Shira.

"Tomorrow we'll climb to Lava Tower (4630m), then descend to Barranco Camp (3950m)," Emmanuel said, "This is 'climb high sleep low' strategy, helps body adapt to altitude."

At 6 PM, we had dinner, then rested early. Blood oxygen saturation: 91%, heart rate: 78 bpm, started showing mild altitude sickness symptoms—slight headache, shortness of breath.

**Day 8: Shira Camp (3840m) → Lava Tower (4630m) → Barranco Camp (3950m)**

At 10 AM, arrived at Lava Tower (4630m). One of Kilimanjaro's highest points, wide view, could see entire Shira Plateau.

"Many climbers give up here," Emmanuel said, "Because altitude too high, severe altitude sickness."

I measured blood oxygen saturation: 88%, heart rate: 85 bpm, obvious altitude sickness symptoms—headache, nausea, shortness of breath.

At 12 PM, started descent to Barranco Camp.

At 3 PM, arrived at Barranco Camp (3950m). Third camp on Machame route, located at foot of Barranco Wall.

At 10 AM, we started climbing Barranco Wall. Emmanuel led ahead, I followed his footsteps, climbing step by step.

"Don't look down," Emmanuel said, "Only look at feet, step by step."

Climbed 1 hour, finally climbed Barranco Wall. From here could see Kibo Peak—Kilimanjaro's highest peak.

At 12 PM, arrived at Karanga Camp (4000m), had lunch.

### 💡 Tips

1. **Altitude acclimatization strategy**: Climb Meru first then Kilimanjaro, this "climb high sleep low" strategy improves summit success rate from 60% to 85%.

2. **Physical preparation**: Start training 3 months ahead, focus on aerobic exercise (running, swimming, cycling) and strength training (legs, core).

3. **Gear selection**: Lightweight is key, every extra kilogram increases climbing difficulty.

4. **Altitude sickness response**: Drink plenty water (3-4 liters daily), walk slowly, don't rush, listen to body signals.

5. **Mental preparation**: Climbing 70% mental battle, 30% physical. Maintain positive mindset, believe in yourself.

6. **Choose professional guide**: Good guide can help you handle altitude sickness, adjust pace, predict weather.

## Summary & Recommendations

This 10-day double peaks challenge made me rediscover mountaineering's philosophy.

I summited Mount Meru (4566m) and Kilimanjaro (5895m), experienced altitude sickness, fatigue, despair, but also saw most beautiful sunrise, most spectacular glaciers, most stunning scenery.

**Why Climb Meru First Then Kilimanjaro**:

1. **Altitude acclimatization**: Mount Meru (4566m) perfect altitude acclimatization training, helps body gradually adapt to high altitude.

2. **Physical preparation**: Meru's steep route exercises leg strength and endurance, prepares for Kilimanjaro.

3. **Mental preparation**: Meru's successful summit builds confidence, prepares for Kilimanjaro's challenge.

4. **Time arrangement**: Climb Meru first then Kilimanjaro, total 10 days, perfect double peaks challenge schedule.

**Advice for Climbers**:

1. **Prepare ahead**: Start training 3 months ahead, focus on aerobic exercise and strength training.

2. **Choose professional guide**: Good guide can help you handle altitude sickness, adjust pace, predict weather.

3. **Bring right gear**: Lightweight is key, every extra kilogram increases climbing difficulty.

4. **Stay patient**: Climbing not race, walk slowly, don't rush, listen to body signals.

5. **Respect nature**: Don't litter, don't destroy vegetation, don't take anything.

6. **Record everything**: Photograph, video, write diary, these records precious memories.

7. **Enjoy process**: Climbing not just summiting, more about enjoying process—scenery, challenge, growth.

**My Mountaineering Philosophy**:

Mountaineering not just conquering peaks, more about conquering yourself.

I summited Kilimanjaro, not to prove I can climb to 5895m, but to prove I can overcome fear, defeat altitude sickness, persist to end.

Mountaineering taught me—patience, persistence, humility, reverence.

When standing at Roof of Africa, looking at world beneath feet, you realize—mountains always there, but life only once.

**Final Final**:

Double peaks challenge not everyone can complete, but if you're ready, go ahead.

Mount Meru gives you perfect altitude acclimatization, Kilimanjaro gives you most spectacular scenery.

10 days, two peaks, life-changing experience.

*Happy Climbing!*
*May you see most beautiful sunrise at Roof of Africa.*
