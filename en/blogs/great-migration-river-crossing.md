## Introduction

"Heavenly Crossing"—one of world's most spectacular natural wonders.

Every July-October, over 2 million wildebeest and zebras migrate from northern Serengeti to Masai Mara, must cross Mara River. Crocodiles lurk in river, lions and leopards wait on banks, this is life and death struggle.

August 2025, I spent 10 days following great migration, finally waited for wildebeest crossing's shocking moment on day 6.

This travelogue shares how to choose best viewing time, mobile camps' advantages, patience and techniques for waiting for crossing.

## Trip Highlights

### Day 1-5: Searching for Great Migration

**Day 1: Arrive in Northern Serengeti**

I chose Kogatende area in northern Serengeti, best location for watching great migration crossing.

My guide was Moses, Maasai guide worked in Serengeti 15 years, knew great migration routes and timing inside out.

"Welcome to northern Serengeti," Moses smiled, "Great migration should arrive soon."

Day 1 afternoon, we drove searching for great migration traces. We saw some wildebeest and zebras on savanna, but not many.

"They still in south," Moses said, "Might take few days to reach here."

**Day 2-3: Continue Searching**

Next two days, we continued searching for great migration traces in northern savanna. We saw some wildebeest and zebras, but numbers still not many.

"Don't worry," Moses said, "Great migration takes time, need patience."

We saw some lions and leopards, they also waiting for great migration arrival.

"They know great migration coming soon," Moses said, "They're ready to hunt."

**Day 4: First See Great Migration**

Day 4 morning, we finally saw great migration's vanguard—at least 1000 wildebeest and zebras, moving toward Mara River.

"They're coming!" Moses excitedly.

We followed great migration, drove toward Mara River. On way, saw more wildebeest and zebras, numbers increasing.

"This is vanguard force," Moses explained, "Main force still behind."

**Day 5: Arrive at Mara River**

Day 5, great migration's main force arrived at Mara River bank. At least 100,000 wildebeest and zebras gathered at riverbank, hesitating whether to cross.

"They're waiting," Moses said, "Waiting for brave individual to lead."

We waited 6 hours at riverbank, but no wildebeest or zebra crossed. They wandered, hesitated, waited at riverside.

"Tomorrow might cross," Moses said, "Keep patience."

### Day 6: Heavenly Crossing

**5:30 AM - Early Departure**

Moses suggested we get up at 5:30: "Morning best time for crossing."

Early morning Mara River beautiful as painting—mist covering river surface, distant mountains faintly visible.

We drove to riverbank, found great migration already gathered—at least 200,000 wildebeest and zebras, squeezed at riverbank, forming long line.

"Today might cross," Moses said, "Keep patience."

**8:00 AM - Waiting Begins**

We waited 2 hours at riverbank, wildebeest and zebras still hesitating. They wandered, tested, waited at riverside.

"They're waiting for brave individual to lead," Moses explained, "Once one leads, others will follow."

**10:00 AM - Crossing Begins**

Suddenly, young wildebeest jumped into river!

"Started!" Moses excitedly.

Immediately, hundreds and thousands of wildebeest and zebras followed and jumped into river. River turbulent, they struggled, moved forward in water, pushed each other.

Crocodiles lurked in river, quietly waiting, ready to hunt.

Lions and leopards on banks, also waiting, ready to hunt.

This was life and death struggle.

**10:30 AM - Crocodile's Hunt**

Suddenly, crocodile rushed toward wildebeest, bit its leg with sharp mouth. Wildebeest struggled, screamed, but soon dragged into water by crocodile.

Other wildebeest and zebras panicked, scattered. But soon, they regrouped, continued crossing.

"This is natural selection," Moses said, "Only strongest survive."

I pressed shutter, recorded this cruel but magnificent scene.

**11:00 AM - Crossing Ends**

Crossing lasted about 1 hour, at least 50,000 wildebeest and zebras successfully crossed, but hundreds killed by crocodiles or drowned in river.

At riverbank, tens of thousands of wildebeest and zebras still waiting, hadn't crossed yet.

"Tomorrow might continue crossing," Moses said, "Today just beginning."

**2:00 PM - Return to Camp**

We returned to camp, mixed emotions. We saw world's most spectacular natural wonder, but also life and death's most cruelty.

### Day 7-10: Continue Waiting

**Day 7-10: Continue Waiting**

Next 4 days, we continued waiting at riverbank. We saw 3 more crossings, each shocking.

Day 7, we saw large-scale crossing—at least 100,000 wildebeest and zebras crossed, lasted 2 hours.

Day 8, we saw small-scale crossing—about 10,000 wildebeest and zebras crossed, lasted 30 minutes.

Day 9, we saw failed crossing—wildebeest and zebras tried to cross, but scared back by crocodiles, didn't cross.

Day 10, we saw final crossing—about 50,000 wildebeest and zebras crossed, lasted 1 hour.

10 days, 5 crossings, tens of thousands of wildebeest and zebras successfully crossed, but thousands killed by crocodiles or drowned in river.

This is "Heavenly Crossing"—world's most spectacular natural wonder, also life and death's most cruelty.

I track great migration, not to see crossing's spectacle, but to understand survival's difficulty.
I record crocodile's hunting, not to show cruelty, but to show natural selection.
I observe wildebeest and zebras' hesitation, not to show cowardice, but to show fear.

Every crossing is life's test.
