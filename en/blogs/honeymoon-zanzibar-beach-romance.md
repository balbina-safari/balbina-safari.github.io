This isn't ordinary honeymoon, this is perfect combination of wilderness and romance—watching lions hunt in Serengeti, watching sunset in Zanzibar; romantic dinner at crater rim, enjoying couple time at private beach.

## Trip Highlights

### Day 1-4: Serengeti - Wilderness Romance

**Day 1: Arrive in Serengeti - First See Lions**

At 10 AM, we arrived in Serengeti. Our guide was David, Tanzanian with 10 years honeymoon Safari experience.

"Welcome to Tanzania," David smiled, "You'll fall in love with here."

At 2 PM, started first game drive. Less than 1 hour, we saw lion pride! 7 lions, including male lion and two females, plus 4 cubs.

"This is our honeymoon gift," Tingting excitedly said, "We saw lions!"

**Day 2: Hot Air Balloon Sunrise - Heaven's Romance**

Got up at 5 AM, departed at 6 AM. Hot air balloon slowly rose, entire Serengeti unfolded beneath us—thousands of wildebeest and zebras like black and white carpet covering savanna, golden morning light just starting to illuminate horizon.

"So beautiful!" Tingting marveled.

Hot air balloon landed on open savanna, staff already set up white tablecloth, silverware, champagne.

"This is our honeymoon breakfast," I smiled, "Eating breakfast on savanna, watching sunrise."

**Day 3: Romantic Dinner at Crater Rim**

Afternoon, we headed to Ngorongoro Crater. Evening, we waited for sunset at crater rim viewpoint.

Sun setting, golden light on crater wall, entire "Eden" dyed golden.

"This is our honeymoon dinner," I smiled, "Eating dinner at crater rim, watching sunset."

David helped set up table—white tablecloth, silverware, candles, flowers. We enjoyed freshly roasted antelope, fresh salad, South African red wine.

"This is my most romantic dinner," Tingting said, "Thank you, husband."

**Day 4: Final Surprise**

Final day, we saw cheetah in Serengeti—lying on rock, black "tear marks" clearly visible.

"This is our honeymoon surprise," Tingting smiled, "We saw cheetah!"

Afternoon, we reluctantly left Serengeti, drove back to Arusha, then flew to Zanzibar.

We ate dinner at crater rim, not to eat, but to witness eternal's love.

Honeymoon is love's witness, love's promise, love's beginning.
