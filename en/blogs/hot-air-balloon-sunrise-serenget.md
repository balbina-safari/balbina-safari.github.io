## Introduction

Get up at 5 AM, spend $599 on hot air balloon, is it worth it?

This was my biggest question when first going on Safari. Hot air balloon is one of Serengeti's most expensive single activities, many people hesitate—is it worth it?

September 2025, I finally experienced hot air balloon sunrise. From takeoff to landing, from champagne celebration to Bush Breakfast, from overlooking wildebeest herds to shocking sunrise.

Spoiler: Super worth! This is my life's most worth $599.

## Complete Experience

### 4:30 AM - Wake Up

At 4:30 AM, camp staff knocked on my door: "Madam, it's time for hot air balloon."

I rubbed eyes and got up, put on warm jacket (early morning Serengeti very cold), brought camera and water bottle.

At 5 AM, hot air balloon company's car came to pick me up. Inside were other 6 tourists—from America, Britain, Germany, Japan, Australia.

"Good morning!" Everyone greeted each other.

### 5:30 AM - Arrive at Takeoff Point

We drove 15 minutes, arrived at takeoff point. Hot air balloon already inflated, giant balloon glistening in morning light.

Pilot was New Zealander, named Mark, with 15 years hot air balloon flying experience.

"Welcome to Serengeti Balloon Safaris," Mark smiled, "Today we'll fly for one hour, you'll see Africa's most beautiful sunrise."

### 6:00 AM - Takeoff

At 6 AM, we started boarding basket. Hot air balloon basket can accommodate 8 people, each has fixed position.

"Are you ready?" Mark asked.

"Ready!" We said in unison.

Hot air balloon slowly rose, I held my breath, watching ground getting farther away.

### 6:10 AM - Overlook Serengeti

Hot air balloon rose to 300 meters altitude, entire Serengeti unfolded beneath us—thousands of wildebeest and zebras like black and white carpet covering savanna, golden morning light just starting to illuminate horizon.

"Look there!" Mark pointed below, "That's the great migration!"

I looked down, at least 100,000 wildebeest and zebras slowly moving on horizon, like black river.

"So shocking!" I marveled.

### 6:30 AM - Cheetah Surprise

Suddenly, Mark said: "Look! Cheetah!"

Following his finger, I saw cheetah chasing gazelle, speed amazing. Although ultimately didn't attack (probably too far away), seeing cheetah hunting from hot air balloon already extremely lucky.

"This is hot air balloon's unique perspective," Mark said, "Only here can you see entire hunting process."

### 7:00 AM - Sunrise's Magnificence

Sun started rising, golden light on savanna, entire Serengeti dyed golden.

"This is Africa's most beautiful sunrise," Mark said, "You're very lucky, perfect weather today."

I pressed shutter, recorded this spectacular moment.

### 7:30 AM - Landing

Hot air balloon started descending. Mark skillfully controlled hot air balloon, slowly landed on open savanna.

"Welcome back to earth!" Mark smiled.

### 8:00 AM - Champagne Celebration

After hot air balloon landed, staff already set up white tablecloth, silverware, champagne.

"Congratulations!" Mark raised champagne, "You just experienced Africa's most beautiful sunrise."

We raised champagne, celebrating this unforgettable flight.

### 8:30 AM - Bush Breakfast

Staff brought breakfast—freshly cooked eggs and bacon, pasta salad, fresh fruits, coffee and tea.

We ate breakfast on savanna, watching giraffes leisurely stroll not far away.

"This is world's most romantic breakfast," Mark said, "Only here can you eat breakfast while watching giraffes."

### 9:30 AM - Return to Camp

After breakfast, we drove back to camp. On way, we still discussed hot air balloon experience.

"This is my life's most worth $599," American tourist said.
"I'll come again," British tourist said.
"I'll recommend to all my friends," German tourist said.
