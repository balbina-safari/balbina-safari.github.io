## Introduction

As a wildlife documentary director, I've traveled to 50+ nature reserves worldwide, filmed countless documentaries. But September 2025's Katavi National Park still shocked me.

Katavi is filming location for BBC documentary "Africa," one of Tanzania's most remote national parks, also one of Earth's most primitive places.

Dry season's Katuma River, spectacular scene of thousands of hippos squeezed together, 1000+ buffalo army, and why this might be Earth's most primitive place.

## Trip Highlights

### Day 1: Arrive in Katavi - Earth's Most Primitive Place

**10:00 AM - Arrive in Katavi**

I took small plane from Arusha to Katavi. Flight time about 2 hours, flying over Serengeti and Ruaha National Parks.

Plane landed at Katavi's airstrip, my guide was Juma, Tanzanian worked in Katavi 10 years.

"Welcome to Katavi," Juma smiled, "This is one of Earth's most primitive places."

**2:00 PM - First Game Drive**

Less than 10 minutes out of camp, I was shocked by sight—at least 1000 buffalo slowly moving on horizon, like black river.

"This is Katavi's buffalo army," Juma said, "Has Africa's largest buffalo population."

I took out camera, started photographing. Buffalo army slowly moving on savanna, kicking up dust, spectacular scene.

**4:00 PM - Katuma River's Hippos**

We headed to Katuma River, saw thousands of hippos squeezed in river—yawning, roaring, pushing each other in river.

"This is Katavi's most spectacular scene," Juma said, "Has Africa's largest hippo population."

I pressed shutter, recorded this spectacular moment.

**7:00 PM - Camp Dinner**

We had dinner at camp. Katavi's night very quiet, only hippo roars and distant lion roars.

"This is Earth's most primitive place," Juma said, "Very few tourists come here."

### Day 2-3: Hippos and Buffalo - Epic Gathering

**Day 2 - Hippo's Epic Gathering**

Day 2, we spent entire day observing hippos at Katuma River.

At least 3000 hippos squeezed in river, yawning, roaring, pushing each other. The sound—like low engine rumbling mixed with burping, full of comedy effect.

"Hippos are among Africa's most dangerous animals," Juma warned, "Kill more people annually than lions."

We waited 6 hours, recorded hippos' various behaviors—yawning, roaring, pushing each other, coming ashore to eat.

"This is Earth's largest hippo gathering," Juma said, "BBC documentary 'Africa' filmed here."

**Day 3 - Buffalo Army**

Day 3, we observed buffalo army.

At least 1000 buffalo slowly moving on savanna, like black river. They grazed, rested, protected each other on savanna.

"Buffalo are one of Big 5," Juma said, "Very dangerous, especially when feel threatened."

We waited 6 hours, recorded buffalo's various behaviors—grazing, resting, protecting each other, fighting lions.

"This is Earth's largest buffalo population," Juma said, "Katavi is buffalo paradise."

### Day 4-5: Final Surprises

**Day 4 - Lion's Hunt**

Day 4, we saw lion's hunt.

Lion pride (8 lions) tracking buffalo army. They ambushed, waited, attacked on savanna.

"Lions are buffalo's main threat," Juma said, "But buffalo also dangerous, they'll fight back."

We waited 4 hours, finally saw lions attack—they rushed toward injured buffalo, attacked with claws and sharp mouth. Buffalo fought back, hit lions with horns.

Ultimately, lions successfully captured buffalo. We recorded entire hunting process, this is documentary-level material.

**Day 5 - Leopard's Surprise**

Day 5, we saw leopard's surprise.

Leopard resting in tree, black spots glistening in sunlight.

"Leopards are hardest of Big 5 to see," Juma said, "Very secretive."

We waited 2 hours, recorded leopard's various behaviors—resting in tree, coming down to drink, returning to tree.

"This is Katavi's surprise," Juma said, "Very few people can see leopards in Katavi."

**My Documentary Philosophy**:

Documentary not just recording animals, more about telling stories.

I filmed hippo gathering, not to show spectacle, but to tell survival's story.
I filmed buffalo migration, not to show numbers, but to tell unity's story.
I filmed lion's hunt, not to show cruelty, but to tell survival's story.

Documentary is story's art, nature's witness, conservation's call.

**Why Katavi Special**:

- **Most primitive**: Katavi is one of Earth's most primitive places, very few tourists
- **Largest populations**: Has Africa's largest hippo and buffalo populations
- **BBC filming location**: BBC documentary "Africa" filmed here
- **Most spectacular**: Hippo and buffalo gatherings are epic-level spectacular scenes

Katavi not place everyone can reach, but if you're ready, go ahead.

*Happy Filming!*
