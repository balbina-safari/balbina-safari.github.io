## Introduction

As an IT engineer, I sit at my computer writing code every day, never exercise, and have poor physical fitness.

In July 2025, I made a crazy decision—to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, the roof of Africa, at an altitude of 5895 meters.

Many people said: "A programmer who never exercises, how can you reach the summit?"

But I proved them wrong—7 days on the Machame Route, I successfully summited the roof of Africa!

This travelogue shares my detailed guide, altitude sickness response, physical preparation, equipment checklist, and the importance of relaxing with a Safari after descending.

## Climbing Guide

### Day 1: Arrive in Arusha - Preparation for Departure

At 10 AM, I arrived in Arusha. My mountain guide was Emmanuel, a Tanzanian with 20 years of climbing experience and 200+ successful Kilimanjaro summits.

"Welcome to Tanzania," Emmanuel smiled, "Are you ready to challenge the roof of Africa?"

In the afternoon of Day 1, I checked my equipment:
- Climbing boots (already broken in)
- Down jacket (-20°C)
- Windproof and waterproof jacket and pants (breathable)
- Thermal underwear (merino wool)
- Fleece jacket
- Quick-dry clothes
- Trekking poles (carbon fiber)
- Headlamp (with spare batteries)
- Sunglasses (UV400 protection)
- Hats (warm hat + sun hat)
- Gloves (warm gloves + waterproof gloves)
- Water bottle (2 liters)
- Power bank
- Sunscreen (SPF50+)
- Lip balm
- Wet wipes

### Day 2: Machame Gate (1800m) → Machame Camp (3000m)

Depart at 8 AM, starting the trek from Machame Gate. Kilimanjaro park entrance fee: $100/person.

Trekking time: 5-7 hours
Elevation gain: 1200 meters
Difficulty: Medium

The first half is tropical rainforest with dense vegetation and many monkeys and birds. The second half is bamboo forest, starting to get steeper.

At 3 PM, arrived at Machame Camp (3000m). This is the first camp of the Machame Route, with tents and toilets.

"Today's elevation gain is relatively mild," Emmanuel said, "Tomorrow will be steeper."

At 7 PM, we had dinner—bean soup, rice, vegetables. Emmanuel measured my blood oxygen saturation: 94%, heart rate: 74 beats/min, everything normal.

### Day 3: Machame Camp (3000m) → Shira Camp (3840m)

Depart at 8 AM, trekking time: 4-6 hours, elevation gain: 840 meters, difficulty: Medium-Hard.

Today's route is steeper, vegetation changes from bamboo forest to alpine meadow. We saw many hyraxes and birds.

At 12 PM, arrived at Shira Camp (3840m). This is the second camp of the Machame Route, located on the Shira Plateau with open views, seeing the main peaks of Kilimanjaro in the distance.

At 2 PM, we trekked to Shira Cathedral (4620m) as acclimatization training: "This will help your body adapt to higher altitudes."

We climbed for 2 hours, reaching Shira Cathedral. From here, you can see Kilimanjaro's three volcanic peaks—Kibo, Mawenzi, Shira.

"Tomorrow we will climb to Lava Tower (4630m), then descend to Barranco Camp (3950m)," Emmanuel said, "This is the 'climb high sleep low' strategy, which helps your body adapt to altitude."

At 6 PM, we had dinner, then rested early. Blood oxygen saturation: 91%, heart rate: 78 beats/min, starting to show mild altitude sickness symptoms—mild headache, rapid breathing.

### Day 4: Shira Camp (3840m) → Lava Tower (4630m) → Barranco Camp (3950m)

Depart at 8 AM, trekking time: 6-8 hours, elevation gain: 790 meters (then descend 690 meters), difficulty: Hard.

Today's route is a classic example of "climb high sleep low"—first climb to Lava Tower (4630m), then descend to Barranco Camp (3950m).

At 10 AM, arrived at Lava Tower (4630m). This is one of the highest points on Kilimanjaro, with open views overlooking the entire Shira Plateau.

"This is where many climbers give up," Emmanuel said, "Because the altitude is too high, altitude sickness is severe."

I measured blood oxygen saturation: 88%, heart rate: 85 beats/min, altitude sickness symptoms obvious—headache, nausea, rapid breathing.

At 12 PM, began descending to Barranco Camp.

At 3 PM, arrived at Barranco Camp (3950m). This is the third camp of the Machame Route, located at the foot of Barranco Wall.

"Tomorrow we will climb Barranco Wall," Emmanuel said, "This is the steepest section, requiring hands and feet."

At 6 PM, we had dinner, then rested early. Blood oxygen saturation: 92%, heart rate: 76 beats/min, altitude sickness symptoms reduced.

### Day 5: Barranco Camp (3950m) → Barafu Camp (4673m)

Depart at 8 AM, trekking time: 6-8 hours, elevation gain: 723 meters, difficulty: Hard.

Today's route includes climbing Barranco Wall—a 300-meter high vertical rock face requiring hands and feet.

At 10 AM, we started climbing Barranco Wall. Emmanuel led the way, I followed his footsteps, climbing up step by step.

"Don't look down," Emmanuel said, "Only look at your feet, take it step by step."

We climbed for 1 hour, finally making it up Barranco Wall. From here, you can see Kibo Peak—the highest peak of Kilimanjaro.

At 12 PM, arrived at Karanga Camp (4000m), had lunch.

At 2 PM, continued trekking to Barafu Camp (4673m). This is the fourth camp of the Machame Route, also the last camp before summiting.

"We'll rest early tonight," Emmanuel said, "Tomorrow we depart at 1 AM to summit Kibo Peak."

At 6 PM, we had dinner, then rested early. Blood oxygen saturation: 89%, heart rate: 82 beats/min, altitude sickness symptoms obvious—headache, nausea, rapid breathing.

### Day 6: Summit Kibo Peak (5895m) → Descend to Mweka Camp (3100m)

Wake up at 1 AM, depart at 2 AM. Headlamp beams flicker in the darkness as we climb up the steep mountain path.

Trekking time: 6-8 hours (ascent) + 4-6 hours (descent)
Elevation gain: 1222 meters
Difficulty: Extremely Difficult

The first half is volcanic ash, sliding down with every step. The second half is rock face, requiring hands and feet.

At 6 AM, we arrived at Stella Point (5756 meters). This is the first "gate" of Kibo Peak, from here you can see Uhuru Peak (5895 meters)—the roof of Africa.

"Only 400 meters left," Emmanuel said, "Hold on!"

We climbed for 1 hour, finally reaching Uhuru Peak (5895 meters). The sun had just risen, golden light spilling over the glaciers, the African continent stretching beneath our feet.

"Congratulations!" Emmanuel hugged me, "You have summited the roof of Africa!"

We stayed at the summit for 30 minutes, taking photos, resting, replenishing energy.

At 7 AM, began descending. Descending is harder than climbing, volcanic ash makes every step feel like skiing.

At 12 PM, arrived at Barafu Camp, had lunch.

At 2 PM, continued descending to Mweka Camp (3100m).

At 5 PM, arrived at Mweka Camp, had dinner.

At 7 PM, blood oxygen saturation: 95%, heart rate: 72 beats/min, altitude sickness symptoms completely disappeared.

### Day 7: Mweka Camp (3100m) → Mweka Gate (1800m) → Return to Arusha

Depart at 8 AM, trekking time: 3-4 hours, elevation loss: 1300 meters, difficulty: Medium.

Today's route is descending, vegetation changes from alpine meadow to tropical rainforest.

At 12 PM, arrived at Mweka Gate (1800 meters). Staff presented me with a summit certificate—green certificate (successfully summited Uhuru Peak).

At 2 PM, returned to Arusha.

## Summary and Recommendations

This 7-day Kilimanjaro climb made me re-understand the meaning of "challenge."

I summited the roof of Africa—Uhuru Peak (5895 meters), experienced altitude sickness, fatigue, despair, but also saw the most beautiful sunrise, most spectacular glaciers, most breathtaking scenery.

**Recommendations for climbers**:

1. **Prepare in advance**: Start training 3 months in advance, focus on aerobic exercise and strength training.

2. **Choose a professional guide**: A good guide can help you cope with altitude sickness, adjust pace, and predict weather.

3. **Bring the right equipment**: Lightweight is key, every extra kilogram adds to the difficulty of climbing.

4. **Be patient**: Climbing is not a race, walk slowly, don't rush, listen to your body's signals.

5. **Respect nature**: Don't litter, don't destroy vegetation, don't take anything.

6. **Record everything**: Take photos, videos, write diaries, these records are precious memories.

7. **Safari after descending**: After descending, it's recommended to go on Safari to relax, recover energy, and celebrate success.

**My climbing philosophy**:

Climbing is not just conquering mountains, but conquering yourself.

I summited Kilimanjaro not to prove I could climb to 5895 meters, but to prove I could overcome fear, defeat altitude sickness, and persist to the end.

Climbing taught me—patience, persistence, humility, awe.

When you stand on the roof of Africa, looking at the world beneath your feet, you realize—the mountain will always be there, but life only happens once.

**Finally**:

Not everyone can summit Kilimanjaro, but if you're ready, go for it.

7 days, Machame Route, 5895 meters, a once-in-a-lifetime challenge.

*Happy Climbing!*
*May you see the most beautiful sunrise at the roof of Africa.*
