## Introduction

As an animal behavior researcher, I spent 10 years studying the social structure and hunting behavior of African lions.

In August 2025, I tracked a lion pride in the Serengeti for 72 hours, from planning, ambush, chase to successful capture.

This travelogue shares the lion's social structure, the male lion's role, the cubs' learning process, and why most hunts fail.

## 72 Hours of Observation

### Day 1: Discovering the Pride - Observing Social Structure

**8:00 AM - Discovering the Pride**

Our guide was David, a Maasai guide who has worked in the Serengeti for 15 years and knows lion behavior inside out.

"Today we'll look for a lion pride," David said, "This pride has 8 lions, including one male lion, two lionesses, and five cubs."

We searched for 1 hour by vehicle, finally finding the pride under an acacia tree—the male lion napping, lionesses grooming the cubs' fur, cubs playing.

**10:00 AM - Observing Social Structure**

We observed the pride for 2 hours, recording their social structure:

- **Male lion**: Protects the territory, doesn't participate in hunting, enjoys priority feeding rights after success
- **Lionesses**: Responsible for hunting, they are the pride's "hunters"
- **Cubs**: Learning hunting skills, starting by observing their mothers

"Lions are the only social felines," David explained, "They have a complex social structure."

**2:00 PM - Planning the Hunt**

In the afternoon, the pride began planning their hunt. The lionesses started observing the surrounding wildebeest herds, looking for suitable prey.

"They're planning," David said, "Lionesses will observe the prey's behavior, looking for the weakest individuals."

We waited for 4 hours, recording the lionesses' planning process—observation, discussion, division of labor.

**6:00 PM - Return to Camp**

We returned to camp, organizing today's observation records. I recorded the pride's social structure, the hunt planning process, the lionesses' division of labor.

### Day 2: Ambush and Chase - The Hunting Process

**6:00 AM - Morning Ambush**

We departed at 6 AM to continue observing the pride. The pride had awakened, and the lionesses began their ambush—hiding in the grass, waiting for the wildebeest herd to approach.

"They're ambushing," David said, "This is the first step of hunting—hiding themselves, waiting for prey to approach."

We waited for 3 hours, recording the lionesses' ambush process—hiding, waiting, observing.

**9:00 AM - The Chase Begins**

Suddenly, a wildebeest approached the ambush point. The lionesses suddenly rushed out of the grass, beginning the chase!

"The hunt has begun!" David said excitedly.

We followed the pride, recording the chase process—speed, coordination, strategy.

The lionesses had clear division of labor—two lionesses chasing from the front, one lioness flanking from the side, another lioness pursuing from behind.

**9:30 AM - Hunt Failed**

Although the lionesses coordinated well, the wildebeest ran too fast and ultimately escaped.

"The hunt failed," David said, "This is normal, most hunts fail."

Statistics show that lion hunting success rate is only 20-30%.

**2:00 PM - Rest After Failure**

After the failed hunt, the pride began resting. The lionesses napped under the acacia tree, the male lion patrolled in the distance.

"They need rest," David said, "Hunting consumes a lot of energy, they need to recover."

We waited for 4 hours, recording the pride's resting behavior—napping, grooming, playing.

### Day 3: Successful Capture - The Learning Process

**6:00 AM - Second Hunt**

We departed at 6 AM to continue observing the pride. The pride had awakened, and the lionesses began planning their second hunt.

"They're planning," David said, "This time they might succeed."

**8:00 AM - Ambush and Chase**

The lionesses began their ambush—hiding in the grass, waiting for the wildebeest herd to approach.

This time, they chose an injured wildebeest—it walked with a limp, clearly a weak individual.

"They chose the weakest prey," David said, "This is the key to hunting—choosing prey that's easy to capture."

The lionesses rushed out of the grass, beginning the chase! This time, they succeeded!

**8:30 AM - Successful Capture**

The lionesses successfully captured the wildebeest. The male lion was the first to come, enjoying priority feeding rights.

"Male lions don't participate in hunting but enjoy priority feeding rights," David explained, "This is the pride's social rule."

The lionesses and cubs waited for the male lion to finish, then began sharing the prey.

**10:00 AM - Cubs' Learning Process**

The cubs began learning hunting skills—they imitated the lionesses' movements, practicing chasing and attacking.

"Cubs learn by observing their mothers," David said, "They need 2-3 years to master hunting skills."

We recorded the cubs' learning process—observation, imitation, practice.

**2:00 PM - Return to Camp**

We returned to camp, organizing these 3 days of observation records. I recorded the pride's social structure, the hunt planning process, the chase process, successful capture, and the cubs' learning process.

## Summary and Recommendations

This 72-hour lion pride observation made me re-understand the meaning of "society."

I observed:
- The pride's social structure
- Lionesses' hunt planning
- The chase process
- Successful capture
- Cubs' learning process

These observations—success, failure, cooperation, learning—are the true face of lion society.

**Recommendations for animal behavior researchers**:

1. **Choose a professional guide**: A good guide can take you to find lion prides, predict their behavior, and explain their actions.

2. **Bring the right equipment**: Telephoto lens is essential, at least 400mm. Tripod improves stability.

3. **Be patient**: Observing lion pride hunting requires patience, maintain patience, wait for the perfect moment.

4. **Respect nature**: Don't disturb animals, don't destroy their habitat, don't use flash.

5. **Record everything**: Take photos, videos, write diaries, these records are valuable for scientific research.

6. **Support conservation**: Lions are endangered species, support conservation organizations, raise conservation awareness.

7. **Share your findings**: Let more people understand lion social structure, raise conservation awareness.

**My research philosophy**:

Animal behavior research is not just observing behavior, but understanding society.

I study lion social structure not to show complexity, but to understand cooperation.
I study lionesses' hunt planning not to show intelligence, but to understand strategy.
I study cubs' learning process not to show cuteness, but to understand education.

Animal behavior research is a mirror of society, a witness to nature, a call for conservation.

**Why lions are special**:

- **Only social felines**: Lions are the only social felines, with complex social structure
- **Lionesses responsible for hunting**: Lionesses are the pride's "hunters," male lions only protect territory
- **Cubs need to learn**: Cubs need 2-3 years to master hunting skills
- **Low hunting success rate**: Lion hunting success rate is only 20-30%

**Finally**:

Observing lion pride hunting is not something everyone can do, but if you're ready, go for it.

72 hours, one lion pride, from planning to successful capture, a once-in-a-lifetime observation.

*Happy Observing!*
*May you understand lion social structure.*
