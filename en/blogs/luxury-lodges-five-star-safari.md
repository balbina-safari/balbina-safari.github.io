## Introduction

As a luxury travel blogger, I've stayed at the most luxurious hotels worldwide—from the Ritz in Paris to overwater villas in the Maldives, from the Burj Al Arab in Dubai to the Plaza in New York.

But in October 2025, my luxury camping experience in Tanzania still shocked me.

From Singita to Four Seasons, 7 days staying at the most luxurious camps in the Northern Circuit. Infinity pools, private butlers, Michelin-level dining, $2000+ per night accommodation—is it worth it?

This travelogue shares my luxury experience.

I chose a private vehicle not to show off, but to enjoy free time.

Luxury is the ultimate in service, the embodiment of taste, the art of living.

Luxury camping is not something everyone can experience, but if you're ready, go for it.
