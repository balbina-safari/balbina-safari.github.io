## Introduction

As a diving instructor, I've dived at the world's most famous dive sites—Great Barrier Reef, Red Sea, Maldives, Palau.

But in February 2025, my experience swimming with whale sharks at Mafia Island still shocked me.

Avoid the crowded Zanzibar, come to Mafia Island to swim with gentle giant whale sharks. Best season October-March, Chole Bay coral reefs, and why this is Tanzania's most underrated island.

This travelogue shares my diving experience.

## Diving Experience

### Day 1: Arrive at Mafia Island - Undiscovered Treasure

**10:00 AM - Arrive at Mafia Island**

We arrived at Mafia Island by boat from Dar es Salaam, a 3-hour journey. Mafia Island is Tanzania's southernmost island, 160 kilometers from Zanzibar.

"Welcome to Mafia Island," the captain said, "This is Tanzania's most underrated island."

Mafia Island is small, only 50 square kilometers, with a population under 20,000. No luxury hotels, no crowded tourists, only clear water, white beaches, undisturbed coral reefs.

**2:00 PM - Explore Mafia Island**

In the afternoon, we explored Mafia Island. The villages here are small, with only a few huts, residents are fishermen.

"Mafia Island is Tanzania's most primitive island," the captain said, "It hasn't been commercialized."

We went to Mafia Island's market, seeing fishermen selling fish—tuna, grouper, lobster.

"This is our main income source," a fisherman said, "We rely on the sea for a living."

**6:00 PM - Sunset**

In the evening, we watched the sunset on the beach. Golden light spilled over the sea, the entire Mafia Island dyed golden.

"This is the most beautiful sunset," the captain said, "Mafia Island's sunset is the most beautiful in the world."

### Day 2: Chole Bay - Coral Reef Paradise

**8:00 AM - Depart for Chole Bay**

On the second day, we took a 15-minute boat ride to Chole Bay, Mafia Island's most famous dive site.

"Chole Bay is the best coral reef dive site," the captain said, "It has the richest marine life."

Chole Bay is a protected coral reef with over 50 coral species and 300 fish species.

**9:00 AM - First Dive**

Our first dive, descending to 15 meters. The scene before me was shocking—colorful corals, schools of fish, giant sea turtles.

"This is the most beautiful coral reef," the captain said, "Chole Bay is Tanzania's best dive site."

We saw:
- Corals: Brain coral, staghorn coral, soft coral
- Fish: Clownfish, butterflyfish, angelfish, grouper
- Marine life: Sea turtles, moray eels, octopus, sharks

**12:00 PM - Lunch**

At noon, we had lunch on the boat. Lunch was traditional Tanzanian food—grilled fish, rice, fruit.

"This is our traditional food," the captain said, "It's delicious."

**2:00 PM - Second Dive**

In the afternoon, our second dive, descending to 20 meters. This time we saw larger marine life—sharks, moray eels, octopus.

"This is the most exciting dive," the captain said, "You'll see large marine life."

We saw:
- Sharks: Whitetip reef sharks, blacktip reef sharks, nurse sharks
- Moray eels: Giant moray eels, spotted moray eels
- Octopus: Blue-ringed octopus, night octopus
- Sea turtles: Green sea turtles, hawksbill sea turtles

### Day 3: Whale Sharks - Gentle Giants

**8:00 AM - Searching for Whale Sharks**

On the third day, we set out to find whale sharks. Whale sharks are the world's largest fish, growing up to 12 meters long and weighing up to 20 tons.

"Whale sharks are gentle giants," the captain said, "They eat plankton, not humans."

We took a 30-minute boat ride, finally finding whale sharks. There were 3 whale sharks, each about 8 meters long, eating plankton on the sea surface.

**9:00 AM - Swimming with Whale Sharks**

We put on diving gear and jumped into the sea, swimming with whale sharks.

Whale sharks are huge but gentle. They swim slowly, eating plankton, completely ignoring us.

"This is the most shocking experience," the captain said, "Swimming with whale sharks is a once-in-a-lifetime experience."

We swam with whale sharks for 30 minutes, watching their huge bodies slowly moving in the water, feeling their gentleness.

**10:00 AM - Photography**

We took photos and videos, recording this shocking experience. The whale sharks were cooperative, swimming slowly, letting us take many photos.

"These are the best photos," the captain said, "You'll remember this moment forever."

### Day 4: Other Dive Sites - Exploring More

**8:00 AM - Kinasi Pass**

On the fourth day, we went to Kinasi Pass, another dive site at Mafia Island. The current here is strong, suitable for experienced divers.

"Kinasi Pass is the most exciting dive site," the captain said, "You'll see large marine life."

We saw sharks, moray eels, octopus, and schools of fish.

**12:00 PM - Lunch**

At noon, we had lunch on Kinasi Island. Kinasi Island is a small island with only one small restaurant, serving traditional Tanzanian food.

"This is the most traditional food," the captain said, "It's delicious."

**2:00 PM - Miewi Island**

In the afternoon, we went to Miewi Island, Mafia Island's southernmost dive site. The water here is shallow, suitable for snorkeling.

"Miewi Island is the best snorkeling site," the captain said, "You'll see many colorful fish."

We snorkeled for 2 hours, seeing colorful corals, schools of fish, giant sea turtles.
