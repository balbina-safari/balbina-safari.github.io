## Introduction

As a travel planner, I've been planning Tanzania trips for 10 years and found an interesting phenomenon—90% of tourists choose Safari + Beach combo.

Why? Because Safari is wild adventure, Beach is relaxing enjoyment, the combination is the perfect travel experience.

This travelogue shares how to allocate days, how to choose between Zanzibar and Mafia Island, domestic flight booking tips, and a complete combo route planning guide.

## Why Choose Safari + Beach Combo

### Safari's Wildness

Safari is wild adventure—early mornings, bumpy rides, dust, waiting.

But Safari is also a shocking experience—lions, elephants, giraffes, zebras, plus the Great Migration, crater, savanna.

"Safari is not a zoo," I always tell my clients, "Safari is real wildlife."

### Beach's Relaxation

Beach is relaxing enjoyment—sunshine, sand, sea, sunset.

Beach is also a healing experience—swimming, diving, massage, gourmet food.

"Beach is not just sunbathing," I always tell my clients, "Beach is healing."

### Perfect Combo

Safari + Beach is the perfect combination—first half adventure, second half relaxation.

"This is the perfect trip," I always tell my clients, "Safari + Beach is the perfect combination."

## Domestic Flight Booking Tips

### Book in Advance

Domestic flights need to be booked in advance, especially during peak season (July-October).

"Book 3 months in advance," I always tell my clients, "Domestic flights are very popular."

### Choose the Right Airport

Zanzibar has two airports:
- Zanzibar Airport (ZNZ): International airport, with international flights
- Zanzibar Airport (ZNZ): Domestic airport, only domestic flights

Mafia Island has no airport, needs boat from Dar es Salaam.

### Book the Right Flight

When booking domestic flights, pay attention to:
- Flight time: Choose morning or afternoon flights, avoid midday flights (too hot)
- Airline: Choose experienced airlines like Air Tanzania, Precision Air
- Flight price: Booking in advance can save 30-50% of cost
- Flight cancellation: Domestic flights often cancel, booking in advance can avoid

### Dealing with Flight Cancellations

If a flight is cancelled, don't panic, you have options:
- Reschedule: Reschedule to next flight
- Refund: Refund and choose other transportation
- Accommodation: If overnight stay is needed, book accommodation
