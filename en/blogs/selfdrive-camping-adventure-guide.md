## Introduction

As a self-drive expert, I've driven the world's most famous self-drive routes—Route 66, Great Ocean Road, Ring Road.

But in July 2025, my self-drive camping experience in Tanzania still shocked me.

Rent a Land Cruiser with a roof tent, drive through the Northern Circuit yourself. International driver's license, public campsite booking, GPS usage, cooking yourself, safety precautions when encountering animals.

This travelogue shares my self-drive camping experience.

After descending to the bottom, the scene before me was shocking beyond words:

A huge "bowl" 20 kilometers in diameter, surrounded by 2000-meter high crater walls. Inside the bowl were emerald green savanna, blue lakes, herds of animals... This is why people call it "African Eden."
