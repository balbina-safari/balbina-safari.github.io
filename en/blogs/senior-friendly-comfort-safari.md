## Introduction

As a filial son, I always wanted to take my 65-year-old parents on a trip. But my parents are older and need special care.

In October 2025, I finally took my parents to Tanzania Safari. Many people say Safari is only for young people, but I wanted to prove—Safari is not just for young people.

This travelogue shares my Safari guide for taking 65-year-old parents—how to choose parks with good roads, accessible hotels, comfortable pace arrangement, preparing an on-board medical kit.

After descending to the bottom, the scene before my parents was shocking beyond words:

A huge "bowl" 20 kilometers in diameter, surrounded by 2000-meter high crater walls. Inside the bowl were emerald green savanna, blue lakes, herds of animals... This is why people call it "African Eden."

"This is the most beautiful crater," my father said, "It's shocking."

Filial piety is not just companionship, but care.

I took my parents on Safari not to let them see animals, but to let them experience life.
I chose accessible hotels not to show off, but to make them comfortable.
I prepared on-board medical kit not to worry, but to make them safe.

Filial piety is the responsibility of care, the warmth of companionship, the expression of love.

**Finally**:

Taking parents on Safari is not something everyone can do, but if you're ready, go for it.

5 days, taking 65-year-old parents on Safari, a once-in-a-lifetime filial journey.
