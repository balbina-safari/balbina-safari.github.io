## Introduction

As an explorer, I've explored the world's wildest places—Amazon rainforest, Antarctica, Sahara Desert.

But in September 2025, my exploration of Tanzania's Southern Circuit still shocked me.

Tired of the Northern Circuit's crowds? The Southern Circuit offers ultimate privacy. Ruaha's elephant kingdom, Nyerere's boat safari, African wild dog tracking, and why this is the real Tanzania.

This travelogue shares my Southern Circuit exploration.
