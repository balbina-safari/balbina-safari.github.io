## Introduction

As a global traveler, I've traveled to the world's most magnificent places—Antarctica, Amazon rainforest, Sahara Desert, Himalayas.

But in October 2025, my 14-day grand tour of Tanzania still shocked me.

This travelogue shares my ultimate Tanzania grand tour.

After descending to the bottom, the scene before me was shocking beyond words:

A huge "bowl" 20 kilometers in diameter, surrounded by 2000-meter high crater walls. Inside the bowl were emerald green savanna, blue lakes, herds of animals... This is why people call it "African Eden."
