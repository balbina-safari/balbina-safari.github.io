## Introduction

As a professional photographer, I've photographed the world's most magnificent scenery—aurora, waterfalls, snow mountains, deserts.

But in September 2025, my wildlife photography in the Serengeti still shocked me.

Follow an award-winning photographer deep into the Serengeti, learn how to capture animal behavior, use morning and evening light, professional post-processing. Camera settings, lens selection, composition techniques, and 10 common mistakes.

This travelogue shares my wildlife photography experience.

## Wildlife Photography Experience

### Day 1: Arrive in Serengeti - Start of Photography Journey

**10:00 AM - Arrive in Serengeti**

We arrived in Serengeti from Kilimanjaro International Airport (JRO). The photography instructor was already waiting at the airport.

"Welcome to Serengeti," the photography instructor said, "This is your photography instructor."

Our photography instructor was Mark, an award-winning photographer with 20 years of wildlife photography experience.

"Welcome," Mark smiled, "I will teach you how to shoot National Geographic-level photos."

**2:00 PM - Check into Camp**

In the afternoon, we checked into camp. The camp was small, only 6 tents, but comfortable.

"This is your photography camp," Mark said, "We start the photography journey tomorrow."

**4:00 PM - Theory Class**

In the afternoon, Mark gave us our first theory class—camera settings.

"Camera settings are the key to success," Mark said, "You must master camera settings."

We learned:
- ISO: 100-400 (sunny), 400-800 (cloudy), 800-1600 (dusk)
- Shutter speed: 1/1000 sec (moving animals), 1/500 sec (stationary animals), 1/250 sec (scenery)
- Aperture: f/4-f/5.6 (animals), f/8-f/11 (scenery)
- Focus: Continuous autofocus (AF-C), single point focus
- White balance: Auto (AWB), sunny (Daylight), cloudy (Cloudy)

**6:00 PM - Dinner**

In the evening, we had dinner at the camp. Dinner was traditional Tanzanian food—roasted meat, rice, vegetables.

"This is traditional Tanzanian food," Mark said, "You'll like it."

### Day 2: Serengeti - Morning and Evening Light

**Day 2: Morning Light Photography**

On the second day at 5 AM, we departed for morning light photography. 5-8 AM is photography's golden hour.

"Morning light is photography's golden hour," Mark said, "Light is soft, colors are rich."

We photographed:
- Lions: Lions in morning light, manes dyed golden
- Elephants: Elephants in morning light, skin dyed golden
- Giraffes: Giraffes in morning light, necks dyed golden
- Zebras: Zebras in morning light, stripes dyed golden

"This is the most beautiful morning light," Mark said, "You shot National Geographic-level photos."

**Day 2: Evening Light Photography**

On the second day at 4 PM, we departed for evening light photography. 4-7 PM is photography's other golden hour.

"Evening light is photography's golden hour," Mark said, "Light is soft, colors are rich."

We photographed:
- Cheetahs: Cheetahs in evening light, tear marks clearly visible
- Leopards: Leopards in evening light, spots shining
- Lions: Lions in evening light, manes dyed golden
- Wildebeest: Wildebeest in evening light, horns dyed golden

"This is the most beautiful evening light," Mark said, "You shot National Geographic-level photos."

### Day 3: Serengeti - Capturing Animal Behavior

**Day 3: Lion Hunting**

On the third day at 5 AM, we departed to photograph lion hunting. Animal behavior is the difficulty of photography.

"Capturing animal behavior is photography's highest level," Mark said, "You must predict animal behavior."

We photographed:
- Lion planning: Lions observing prey, planning the hunt
- Lion ambush: Lions hiding in grass, waiting for prey to approach
- Lion chase: Lions rushing out of grass, beginning the chase
- Lion success: Lions successfully capturing prey

"This is the most shocking animal behavior," Mark said, "You shot National Geographic-level photos."

**Day 3: Cheetah Hunting**

On the third day at 4 PM, we departed to photograph cheetah hunting. Cheetahs are Africa's fastest land animals, speed up to 120 km/h.

"Cheetah hunting is photography's challenge," Mark said, "You must use high shutter speed."

We photographed:
- Cheetah observation: Cheetah observing prey, looking for opportunities
- Cheetah chase: Cheetah rushing out, beginning the chase
- Cheetah success: Cheetah successfully capturing prey
- Cheetah rest: Cheetah resting, recovering energy

"This is the most shocking cheetah hunting," Mark said, "You shot National Geographic-level photos."

### Day 4: Serengeti - Composition Techniques

**Day 4: Composition Theory**

On the fourth day at 8 AM, Mark gave us our second theory class—composition techniques.

"Composition is photography's soul," Mark said, "You must master composition techniques."

We learned:
- Rule of thirds: Divide the frame into thirds, place the subject at intersection points
- Diagonal lines: Use diagonal lines to add movement to the frame
- Framing: Use framing to add depth to the frame
- Symmetry: Use symmetry to add balance to the frame
- Leading lines: Use leading lines to guide the viewer's eye

**Day 4: Composition Practice**

On the fourth day at 2 PM, we departed to practice composition techniques. We photographed:
- Rule of thirds: Lions at rule of thirds intersection points
- Diagonal lines: Elephants on diagonal lines
- Framing: Giraffes in acacia tree framing
- Symmetry: Zebras' symmetrical stripes
- Leading lines: Wildebeest herds forming leading lines on the horizon

"This is the most beautiful composition," Mark said, "You shot National Geographic-level photos."

### Day 5: Serengeti - Lens Selection

**Day 5: Lens Theory**

On the fifth day at 8 AM, Mark gave us our third theory class—lens selection.

"Lenses are photography's tools," Mark said, "You must choose the right lens."

We learned:
- Telephoto lens: 400mm-600mm, for photographing distant animals
- Medium telephoto lens: 70mm-200mm, for photographing mid-distance animals
- Wide-angle lens: 16mm-35mm, for photographing scenery and animal groups
- Macro lens: 100mm, for photographing animal details

**Day 5: Lens Practice**

On the fifth day at 2 PM, we departed to practice lens selection. We photographed:
- Telephoto lens: Distant lions, using 600mm lens
- Medium telephoto lens: Mid-distance elephants, using 200mm lens
- Wide-angle lens: Scenery and animal groups, using 16mm lens
- Macro lens: Lions' eyes, using 100mm macro lens

"This is the most beautiful lens selection," Mark said, "You shot National Geographic-level photos."

### Day 6: Serengeti - Post-Processing

**Day 6: Post-Processing Theory**

On the sixth day at 8 AM, Mark gave us our fourth theory class—post-processing.

"Post-processing is photography's final step," Mark said, "You must master post-processing techniques."

We learned:
- Lightroom: Adjust exposure, contrast, saturation, sharpening
- Photoshop: Fix flaws, adjust colors, add effects
- Noise reduction: Reduce ISO noise
- Color correction: Correct white balance, adjust colors

**Day 6: Post-Processing Practice**

On the sixth day at 2 PM, we began post-processing. We processed:

- Giraffe photos: Fixed flaws, added effects
- Zebra photos: Corrected white balance, adjusted colors

"This is the most beautiful post-processing," Mark said, "You shot National Geographic-level photos."

### Day 7: Serengeti - 10 Common Mistakes

**Day 7: Mistakes Theory**

On the seventh day at 8 AM, Mark gave us our fifth theory class—10 common mistakes.

"Avoiding common mistakes is the key to success," Mark said, "You must know what mistakes are."

We learned 10 common mistakes:
1. **ISO too high**: ISO too high produces noise, affecting photo quality
2. **Shutter too slow**: Shutter too slow causes photo blur, especially when photographing moving animals
3. **Aperture too large**: Aperture too large causes depth of field too shallow, subject not clear
4. **Focus not accurate**: Focus not accurate causes subject blur, photo not clear
5. **Poor composition**: Poor composition causes photo not attractive
6. **Poor light**: Poor light causes photo not layered
7. **Wrong lens selection**: Wrong lens selection causes photo not ideal
8. **Over post-processing**: Over post-processing causes photo not natural
9. **No patience**: No patience causes missing best shooting opportunity
10. **Disrespect animals**: Disrespecting animals causes animals to leave, unable to photograph

**Day 7: Mistakes Practice**

On the seventh day at 2 PM, we departed to avoid common mistakes. We photographed:
- ISO: Use correct ISO, avoid noise
- Shutter: Use correct shutter speed, avoid photo blur
- Aperture: Use correct aperture, ensure appropriate depth of field
- Focus: Use correct focus, ensure subject clear
- Composition: Use correct composition, ensure photo attractive

"This is the most beautiful photos," Mark said, "You avoided all common mistakes."
