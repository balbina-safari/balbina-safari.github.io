## Introduction

As an independent traveler, I've traveled to the world's most magnificent places—Paris, Tokyo, New York, London.

But in September 2025, my women-only Safari experience in Tanzania still shocked me.

All-female guides, all-female drivers, all-female companions, plus Spa and yoga. This is not just a Safari, but a journey of women's empowerment.

This travelogue shares my women-only Safari experience.

## Women-Only Safari Experience

### Day 1: Arrive in Serengeti - Start of Women's Empowerment

**10:00 AM - Arrive in Serengeti**

We arrived in Serengeti from Kilimanjaro International Airport (JRO). The women-only Safari team was already waiting at the airport.

"Welcome to Serengeti," the women-only Safari founder said, "This is your female guide."

Our female guide was Grace, a Tanzanian woman with 15 years of Safari experience.

"Welcome," Grace smiled, "I will take you on a journey of women's empowerment."

**2:00 PM - Check into Camp**

In the afternoon, we checked into the women-only camp. The camp was small, only 6 tents, but comfortable.

"This is your women-only camp," Grace said, "Only women here."

**4:00 PM - Yoga**

In the afternoon, we began yoga. Yoga is part of the women-only Safari, helping us relax body and mind.

"Yoga is the start of women's empowerment," Grace said, "It will help you relax body and mind."

We did 1 hour of yoga, feeling very relaxed.

"This is the most relaxing yoga," Grace said, "You'll like it."
