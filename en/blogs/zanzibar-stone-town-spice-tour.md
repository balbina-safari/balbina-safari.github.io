## Introduction

As a history enthusiast, I've explored the world's oldest cities—Rome, Athens, Istanbul, Cairo.

But in November 2025, my exploration of Zanzibar's Stone Town still shocked me.

Beyond just lying on the beach, Zanzibar has rich history and culture. Maze-like Stone Town, Sultan's Palace, slave trade relics, spice farms, and Freddie Mercury's childhood home.

This travelogue shares my Zanzibar Stone Town exploration.
