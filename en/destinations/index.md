# 14 Destinations, 14 Faces of Africa

From the endless plains of the Serengeti to the glacier-capped peaks of Kilimanjaro; from the white sands of Lake Tanganyika to the spice markets of Zanzibar—the diversity of Tanzania is beyond imagination.

Here lies the world's most spectacular wildlife migration, Africa's highest peak, the earliest footprints of humanity, and 400 years of Swahili culture. Each of these 14 destinations is worthy of its own journey, and each can change your perception of Africa.

**How to Choose?** First-time visitors should start with the Northern Circuit; veteran players can explore the South and West; trekking enthusiasts can challenge Kilimanjaro; and vacationers can head to Zanzibar.

## Northern Circuit - The Classic Face of Africa

This is Tanzania's calling card and where most people's African dreams begin.

With the most mature infrastructure, highest wildlife density, and widest range of accommodations, the Northern Circuit is the best choice for a first-time Safari. Starting from Arusha, you can reach any park within a 3–4 hour drive, making it ideal for travelers with limited time who want to see the best.

**Recommended Duration**: 5–7 Days | **Best Season**: Year-round (Peak migration July–October)

## Southern Circuit - The True Face of Wilderness

If the North is "sightseeing," the South is "expedition."

Fewer people, longer distances, and intense wildness—the Southern Circuit preserves the most primal state of Africa. Ruaha's 12,000 elephants, Nyerere's boat safaris, and Mikumi's "Mini-Serengeti"—these experiences belong to those willing to venture further.

- [**Ruaha National Park**]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ prefix }}/destinations/ruaha)
  - > Tanzania's largest park; a paradise for elephants and wild dogs
- [**Nyerere National Park (Selous)**]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ prefix }}/destinations/nyerere)
  - > Africa's largest national park; unique boat safari experiences
- [**Mikumi National Park**]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ prefix }}/destinations/mikumi)
  - > Most accessible from Dar es Salaam; often called "Mini-Serengeti"

## Western Circuit - Call of the Secret Realm

Tanzania's most remote, hardest to reach, and most unforgettable corners.

Accessible only by small aircraft and hosting less than 1% of the visitors that the North receives, the Western Circuit is a true hidden gem. Chimpanzee tracking in Mahale, thousands of hippos gathered in Katavi, and white sands on Lake Tanganyika—these are experiences you won't find anywhere else on Earth.

**Recommended Duration**: 8–12 Days | **Suitable for**: Deep explorers, primate lovers

  - > World's largest hippo gatherings and spectacular buffalo herds
- [**Mahale Mountains National Park**]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ prefix }}/destinations/mahale)
  - > Wild chimpanzee tracking + white beach relaxation on Lake Tanganyika

## Islands & Coasts - The Other Tanzania

Beyond the savanna, there is the Indian Ocean.

Stone Town in Zanzibar, Whale Sharks in Mafia, and Beach Safaris in Saadani—Tanzania's coastline is equally thrilling. Many choose the "Safari + Beach" combination to first chase animals on the plains and then unwind by the sea, a contrast that makes the entire journey complete.

**Recommended Duration**: 3–5 Days (as a Safari extension) | **Best Season**: Year-round

- [**Zanzibar Island**]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ prefix }}/destinations/zanzibar)
  - > The Spice Island; a perfect blend of Stone Town history and stunning beaches
- [**Saadani National Park**]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ prefix }}/destinations/saadani)
  - > The only park in East Africa where beach and wildlife meet
- [**Mafia Island**]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ prefix }}/destinations/mafia)
  - > Swim with Whale Sharks; a world-class diving paradise
