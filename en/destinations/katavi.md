### 🌍 Tanzania's Last Wilderness

Katavi National Park is Tanzania's **third-largest national park** (4,471 square kilometers), but also likely the **least visited**.

Here there are no luxury hotels, no tourist crowds, not even paved roads. Coming to Katavi means returning to the real, original, undisturbed Africa. If you want to experience "Safari with only me and the animals," Katavi is the only answer.

### 🦛 Empire of Hippos

Katavi's most dramatic spectacle occurs along the **Katuma River** during the dry season (August-October).

As other water sources in the park gradually dry up, thousands of animals gather along this remaining river. The channel grows narrower, and **hippo density reaches unbelievable levels**—sometimes several hippos挤 together per square meter.

*   During the day, hippos stack like sardines in the mud, occasionally erupting in fierce fights for space.
*   At dusk, hippos emerge to feed, and you can hear their low grunts echoing through the darkness.

### 🐃 Kingdom of Buffalo

Beyond hippos, Katavi is famous for its **breathtaking buffalo herds**.

On the Chada floodplains, you can sometimes see more than **1,000 buffalo** moving in a dark mass, kicking up clouds of dust. Buffalo herds of this scale are rarely seen elsewhere in East Africa.

### 🦁 Predator's Paradise

Such dense prey naturally attracts numerous predators:
*   **Lions**: Katavi's lions are known for hunting buffalo—you might witness entire prides surrounding massive male buffalo.
*   **Hyenas**: Numerous, their eerie laughter often echoes at night.
*   **Crocodiles**: Waiting in the rivers for careless animals.

### 🎬 BBC's Favorite

Due to its spectacular wildlife gatherings and pristine landscapes, Katavi became a key filming location for **BBC's "Africa"**. Many classic shots of hippos fighting for territory and lions hunting buffalo come from here.

### 💡 Travel Tips

*   **How to Get There**: Usually requires flying from Dar es Salaam or Arusha to Katavi's airstrip (about 2-3 hours).
*   **Accommodation**: A few camps like Katavi Wildlife Camp and Chada Katavi offer accommodation—relatively simple but professionally managed.
*   **Best Experience**: Visit during the dry season. Other times, the park is relatively empty and roads are difficult.
*   **Combined Itinerary**: Often paired with Mahale Mountains (chimpanzee paradise) for a Western Circuit experience.
