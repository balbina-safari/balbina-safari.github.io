### 🚗 Dar es Salaam's Backyard

Mikumi National Park is Tanzania's **fourth-largest national park** and the **most easily accessible wildlife reserve from Dar es Salaam**.

Driving along the Dar-Iringa highway for just **4 hours** brings you to this 3,230-square-kilometer wilderness. This makes Mikumi the top choice for weekend getaways for capital residents and the perfect starting point for international visitors on the Southern Circuit.

### 🦁 "Mini Serengeti"

Mikumi's heart is the vast **Mkata Floodplain**—this open grassland resembles the Serengeti in landscape: golden grass stretching to the horizon, dotted with sparse umbrella acacia trees, with the Rubeho and Uluguru mountain ranges on the horizon.

*   **Dry Season (June-October)**: Large numbers of wildebeest, zebras, impalas, and buffalo gather on the plains.
*   **Rainy Season (November-May)**: Though roads may be muddy, this is the golden season for birdwatching, with migratory birds bringing over 400 species.

### 🦒 High-Frequency Wildlife Sightings

While Mikumi's total wildlife count doesn't match Serengeti or Ruaha, due to the park's relatively small size and concentrated animal distribution, **sighting rates are very high**:

*   **Elephants**: Moving in herds across the plains or drinking at waterholes.
*   **Giraffes**: Elegantly feeding among acacia trees.
*   **Lions**: Often sunbathing in the central area of Mkata Plains.
*   **Baboons and Vervet Monkeys**: Playing in trees along roadsides.

### 🌳 Diverse Ecosystems

Beyond open grasslands, Mikumi also includes:
*   **Miombo Woodland**: Tanzania's southern characteristic savanna woodland ecosystem.
*   **Riverine Forest**: Growing along the Mkata River banks, where hippos reside.
*   **Hippo Pools**: One of the park's signature attractions, offering close-up observation of hippos and crocodiles.

### 💡 Practical Tips

*   **Best For**: Travelers with limited time departing from Dar es Salaam; budget backpackers wanting wildlife experience.
*   **Accommodation**: Options range from Bastian Campsite inside the park to mid-range hotels outside (like Vuma Hills Tented Camp).
*   **Combined Itinerary**: Often combined with Ruaha or Nyerere for 3-5 day Southern Circuit itineraries.
