### 🌍 Africa's Largest Wildlife Reserve

Nyerere National Park (formerly part of the Selous Game Reserve) was officially established in 2019, covering over **30,000 square kilometers**, making it **Africa's largest independent national park**.

Named after Tanzania's founding president Julius Nyerere to honor his contributions to wildlife conservation, the park's heart is the magnificent **Rufiji River**—Tanzania's largest river.

### 🚤 Boat Safari: A Different Experience

What makes Nyerere unique is the opportunity for **boat safaris**.

Sitting in a small boat, slowly cruising along the Rufiji River:
*   **Hippo pods** play in the water, occasionally revealing massive mouths.
*   **Nile Crocodiles** lazily sunbathe on riverbanks, some individuals reaching 5 meters in length.
*   **Elephant families** come to drink, with calves playing in shallow water.
*   Various waterbirds (pelicans, fish eagles, kingfishers) circle overhead or perch on branches.

This close-range, low-angle observation is incomparable to land-based game drives.

### 🐕 Paradise for Wild Dogs

Nyerere is one of the places in East Africa with the **highest numbers of African wild dogs**.

Its vast territory and abundant prey provide ideal habitat for wild dog packs. During the dry season, in open Miombo woodlands, you can often see entire packs (sometimes up to 20 dogs) hunting impalas and other medium-sized antelopes cooperatively.

### 🚶 Walking Safari

Unlike the Northern Circuit, Nyerere permits **walking safaris**.

Led by an armed guide, you can trek deep into the bush for the most authentic African adventure:
*   Learn to track animal footprints and droppings.
*   Observe small animals and insects at close range.
*   Feel the adrenaline rush of being in the wild without vehicle protection.

### 🐘 Biodiversity Treasure Trove

Nyerere's wildlife diversity is incredibly rich:
*   **World's largest hippopotamus population** (estimated over 30,000).
*   **Nile Crocodiles**: Astonishing numbers—one of the world's largest crocodile gatherings.
*   **Elephants**: Over 65,000.
*   **Lions, Leopards, Cheetahs**: Stable populations and relatively easy to observe.

### 💡 Practical Information

*   **Transport**: Small plane from Dar es Salaam takes about 45 minutes to reach airstrips within the park.
*   **Accommodation**: Top camps like Rufiji River Camp and Sand Rivers Selous offer luxury wilderness experiences.
*   **Best Experience**: Combining boat safaris, land game drives, and walking safaris provides the complete Nyerere experience.
