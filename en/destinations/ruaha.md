### 🦁 Tanzania's Largest and Wildest Park

Ruaha National Park is Tanzania's **largest national park** (over 20,000 square kilometers, larger than the Serengeti), yet its fame pales compared to the Northern Circuit.

This "obscurity" has become its greatest advantage: **ultimate wilderness and privacy**. Here, you might go all day without seeing another safari vehicle. The nature here is unadorned, pristine, belonging to true adventurers.

### 🐘 Kingdom of Elephants

Ruaha has one of East Africa's **largest elephant populations**, estimated at over 12,000.

During the dry season (June-October), when surrounding water sources dry up, hundreds of elephants gather along both banks of the **Great Ruaha River**. You can see:
*   Elephant herds queuing orderly to drink.
*   Huge-tusked bulls digging for groundwater in the riverbed.
*   Calves playing and wrestling in the mud.

### 🐕 Last Stronghold of African Wild Dogs

Ruaha is one of East Africa's most important habitats for **African Wild Dogs**.

This endangered canid is famous for its exceptional team hunting skills and high success rate (about 80%). Their colorful coats and large ears are unforgettable. In Ruaha, you have a fairly high probability of encountering them—especially at dawn and dusk.

### 🦁 Meeting Point of East and Southern African Wildlife

Ruaha sits on the **boundary between East African and Southern African wildlife zones**, giving it uniquely diverse biodiversity.

You can observe both:
*   **East African species**: Grant's gazelles, giraffes.
*   **Southern African species**: Elands, sable antelopes.
*   **Amphibious species**: Lions, leopards, and cheetahs all exist in high densities here.

### 🏞️ Dramatic Landscapes

Ruaha's terrain is more varied and undulating than the Serengeti:
*   **Great Ruaha River**: Becomes a lifeline during dry season, with thousands of animals gathering along its banks.
*   **Mwagusi Sand River**: During dry season, becomes an ambush point for large cats.
*   **Kopjes (Rock Outcrops)**: Massive granite rock piles are lions' favorite lookout points.

### 💡 Travel Tips

*   **How to Get There**: Small planes from Dar es Salaam or Arusha fly directly to airstrips within the park.
*   **Accommodation**: A few high-end camps inside the park, such as Jongomero Camp and Ruaha River Lodge.
*   **Note**: This is a true "wilderness" experience with relatively simple facilities, which is precisely why it's so authentic.
