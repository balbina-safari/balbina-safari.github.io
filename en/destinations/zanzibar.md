### 🏖️ Gentle After the Wild

After days of dusty Safari game drives or the grueling Kilimanjaro climb, nowhere is better for relaxation than Zanzibar.

This is the **"Spice Island"**, where the air is filled with scents of cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Turquoise Indian Ocean waves lap against white sand beaches, while ancient Arab architecture tells stories spanning a millennium.

### 🕌 Stone Town

This is Zanzibar's soul. Walking into Stone Town feels like stepping into tales from *One Thousand and One Nights*.

*   **Maze Alleys**: Getting lost in narrow winding streets is the greatest joy. You'll see exquisite **Zanzibar doors**—each representing the owner's status and story.
*   **Stone Benches (Baraza)**: The center of local social life where people gather to drink coffee, chat, and play games.
*   **Freddie Mercury**: The Queen frontman's former home is here—music fans shouldn't miss it.

### 🌊 Northern Beaches (Nungwi & Kendwa)

With minimal tidal impact, these offer the island's best beaches. You can:

1.  **Swim All Day**: Crystal-clear, jelly-like water visible to the bottom.
2.  **Diving and Snorkeling**: Explore the vibrant coral reefs and tropical fish of Mnemba Atoll.
3.  **Sunset Cruise**: At dusk, board a traditional dhow and enjoy seafood BBQ and cold drinks against a sunset backdrop.

### 🐢 Prison Island and Spice Farms

*   **Prison Island**: Despite its intimidating name, it's a paradise filled with giant tortoises. You can hand-feed these centenarian reptiles.
*   **Spice Tour**: Visit local farms to see how familiar spices like pepper, vanilla, and cinnamon grow, and taste fresh tropical fruits.
