### 🦁 Wake Up in Nature's Embrace

This is the most famous luxury lodge in the Serengeti, perfectly embodying the combination of "wilderness and luxury." The lodge has no fences; instead, elevated wooden walkways connect the various rooms, allowing wildlife to roam freely beneath.

### ✨ Core Experience: The Iconic Infinity Pool

The most iconic image of Four Seasons is undoubtedly its infinity pool. Right in front of the pool is a natural water hole. Every day at noon, herds of elephants, and even lions and buffalo, come here to drink. You can sip cocktails in the pool while "face-to-face" with elephants and their calves just meters away.

### 🛏️ Rooms and Facilities

*   **Horizon Room**: Each room features a private balcony facing the sunset over the Serengeti plains.
*   **Terrace Suite**: Suite with private pool, perfect for honeymoon couples seeking absolute privacy.
*   **Dining**: The lodge has three independent restaurants, including Boma Grill (serving authentic African game around a bonfire) and Maji Bar, offering international cuisine 24/7.

### 🎓 Educational Entertainment

The lodge features an interactive **Discovery Centre** where you can review animal photos taken during the day with resident biologists and learn about the real-time location of the Great Migration through 3D maps. This is an excellent place for children to learn about nature education.
