### 🏙️ The Perfect Starting Point for Your Journey

For most travelers arriving in Tanzania after long-haul flights, Gran Melia Arusha is the most comfortable buffer zone. It's not only Arusha's **most luxurious and modern** hotel but also an urban oasis.

### 🏔️ Sleeping with the Volcano

The hotel's design philosophy is "fusion of nature and modernity." Most touching is that almost all room balconies face the majestic **Mount Meru**. Waking up in the morning, opening the curtains, and sipping a pour-over coffee while watching the mist-shrouded volcano peak is a unique Arusha morning.

### ☕ Coffee and Gardens

Arusha is Tanzania's coffee capital, and Gran Melia has brought the coffee plantation right into the hotel.
*   **Coffee Tour**: You can visit coffee trees directly in the hotel garden, learn about coffee bean picking and roasting, and taste a cup of the freshest Arabica.
*   **Tea Restaurant**: The hotel's Yellow Chilli restaurant is helmed by Michelin-starred chef Sanjeev Kapoor, offering extremely high-quality Indian cuisine, perfect for comforting Chinese stomachs craving "hot meals."
