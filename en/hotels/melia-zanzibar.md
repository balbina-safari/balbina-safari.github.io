### 🏝️ The Perfect Indian Ocean Holiday

If you want to do nothing in one place—just lie flat, eat, drink, and watch the sea—then Melia Zanzibar is the best value choice.

This is a luxury resort using the **"All-Inclusive"** model. This means from the moment you check in, all restaurants (including three themed restaurants), bar cocktails, drinks in the fridge, and even snacks on the beach are all free and unlimited.

### 🏖️ Gabi Beach: Your Private Beach

The hotel has a private white sand beach—Gabi Beach—accessible only to guests.
*   The hotel provides golf cart shuttle to and from the beach (though walking takes only 10 minutes).
*   The beach has a bar, hammocks, loungers, and a DJ playing lazy music.
*   The water is perfect turquoise, and the sand is soft as powder.

### 🍽️ Culinary Journey

Since it's all-inclusive, dining becomes very important. Melia's dining is excellent:
1.  **Spice Market**: Main buffet restaurant, changing cuisine themes daily (Mediterranean Night, African Night, etc.).
2.  **Jetty Lounge**: Pier bar built deep in the ocean, perfect spot for watching sunrise and sunset.
3.  **Aqua**: Cliff restaurant featuring exquisite Mediterranean cuisine (reservation required, free for some room categories).
