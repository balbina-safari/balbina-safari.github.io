### 🌳 Living on the Shoulders of Giants

This might be the ultimate version of your childhood dream—a home in the trees, but with five-star hotel comfort.

Each suite at Elewana Tarangire Treetops is built atop ancient **baobab and marula trees**. The room floors are several meters above ground, accessed by spiral staircases. This unique elevation not only provides excellent ventilation but also gives you a god's-eye view to watch elephant herds passing beneath the trees.

### 🛖 65-Square-Meter Sky Suites

The room design is very bold, with the front almost entirely open (equipped with mosquito nets and canvas curtains), allowing you to see the sunrise and starry sky directly from bed.
The suites measure 65 square meters and include a double shower and a huge private terrace.

### 🌌 Magical Nights

The nights here are magical.
*   **Boma Dinner**: Usually served outdoors in a traditional Boma (a circular area enclosed by branches), with sand underfoot, the Milky Way overhead, accompanied by Maasai warrior songs and dances.
*   **Night Game Drive**: Since the camp is located in a private conservancy (WMA), **night game drives** are allowed here, which are prohibited in national parks. You'll use spotlights to find nocturnal animals you can't see during the day: honey badgers, porcupines, and even hunting lions.
