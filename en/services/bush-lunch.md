# Bush Lunch

## 🍽️ Service Overview

Bush Lunch is a unique Safari dining experience—spreading a picnic blanket under the shade of an acacia tree and enjoying freshly cooked hot meals. This is a romantic choice that perfectly combines fine dining with the wilderness.

## 🌳 Typical Scene

Your driver and chef will arrive early at the designated picnic spot (usually a scenic hilltop or riverside location) and prepare lunch while you're watching wildlife. When you arrive, the table is already set, with hot food waiting for you.
