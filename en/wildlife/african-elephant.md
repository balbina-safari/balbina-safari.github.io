## Conservation Status

### Conservation Status: **Endangered**

### Threat Factors
1. **Ivory Poaching**: 1970-1980s, African elephant population decreased from 1.3 million to 600,000
2. **Habitat Loss**: Agricultural expansion, human settlement leading to habitat fragmentation
3. **Human-Elephant Conflict**: Elephants destroy crops, killed in retaliation by humans
4. **Climate Change**: Drought intensification, reduced water sources

### Conservation Measures
- **International Ivory Trade Ban**: 1989 CITES Convention implementation
- **National Park Protection**: Tanzania established multiple protected areas
- **Anti-Poaching Patrols**: Increased patrol efforts, cracking down on poaching
- **Community Conservation**: Encourage local community participation, provide alternative livelihoods

### Population Recovery
- **Tanzania**: Recovered from 50,000 in 1980s to 120,000 today
- **Tarangire**: Has one of East Africa's largest elephant herds, approximately 3,000
