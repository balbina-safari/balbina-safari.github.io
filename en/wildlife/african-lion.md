## 🦁 Lion - King of Beasts

### Overview

The African lion is the most iconic animal on the African savanna, known as the "King of Beasts." They are the only cat species that lives in groups, with complex social structures and group hunting strategies making them apex predators in the ecosystem.

### Social Structure

#### Pride Composition
A typical pride consists of:
- **1-3 Adult Males**: Responsible for defending territory, fighting with intruding males
- **4-6 Adult Females**: Core members, responsible for hunting and raising cubs
- **Several Cubs**: Juvenile lions under 2 years old

**Key Points**:
- Females are the stable core of the pride, usually mother-daughter, sister relationships, never leave their birth pride
- Males are typically replaced every 2-3 years by stronger intruding males
- New males will kill all cubs of previous males to bring females into estrus quickly

### Hunting Behavior

#### Clear Division of Labor
- **Main Force**: Females responsible for 90%+ of hunting
- **Strategy**: Teamwork, flanking, ambush, chasing with division of labor
- **Time**: Mainly hunt at dusk and night (night vision 6 times better than humans)
- **Success Rate**: Only about 20-30%

#### Main Prey
1. **First Choice**: Wildebeest, zebra (moderate size, nutritious)
2. **Second Choice**: Buffalo, giraffe (requires entire pride cooperation)
3. **Opportunistic**: Warthog, gazelle and other small animals

**Hunting Techniques**:
- Use grass and bushes as cover, approach quietly within 30 meters
- Coordinate attack timing through roars and eye contact
- Usually one or two females responsible for final sprint and pounce
- After killing prey, males eat first (despite not participating in hunting)

### Territory and Roaring

#### Territory Range
- Male territory can reach 20-400 square kilometers (depending on prey density)
- Mark territory through urine and roaring

#### Iconic Roar
- **Volume**: Can reach 114 decibels, audible 8 kilometers away
- **Function**: Declare territory, gather companions, intimidate opponents
- **Time**: Mainly roar at dawn and dusk
- **Identification**: Each lion's roar is unique, like human fingerprints

### Reproduction and Cub Rearing

#### Reproductive Cycle
- **Estrus**: Females come into estrus 2-4 times per year, lasting 4-7 days each time
- **Gestation**: About 110 days (3.5 months)
- **Litter Size**: Usually 2-4 cubs

#### Cub Growth
- **Birth**: Eyes closed, completely dependent on mother
- **1 Month**: Start learning to walk, follow mother
- **3 Months**: Weaned, start eating meat
- **1 Year**: Participate in hunting training
- **2 Years**: Male cubs expelled from pride, start nomadic life
- **3-4 Years**: Reach sexual maturity

**Brutal Reality**:
- Cub mortality rate reaches 60-70%
- Main causes: Starvation, killed by new males, attacked by other predators (hyenas, leopards)

### Relationship with Humans

#### Conservation Status
- **Historical Population**: About 450,000 in early 20th century
- **Current Population**: Only 20-25,000 remaining (95% reduction)
- **Main Threats**: Habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, poaching
- **Protection Level**: IUCN Red List - Vulnerable

#### In Tanzania
- Serengeti has East Africa's largest lion population (about 3,000)
- Ngorongoro Crater has extremely high lion density
- Research Value: Many long-term research projects (e.g., "Serengeti Lion Project" started in 1966)

### Safari Observation Tips

#### Best Viewing Times
- **Early Morning (6-8am)**: Returning from night hunting, may see feeding scenes
- **Late Afternoon (4-7pm)**: Becoming active, preparing to hunt
- **Avoid**: Midday (too hot, lions all sleep in shade)

#### Behavior Identification
- **Lazily Lying**: Resting, can sleep up to 20 hours daily
- **Frequent Grooming**: Social behavior, strengthens group cohesion
- **Tail Upright**: Excited, alert state
- **Low Growl**: May be driving away hyenas or other competitors

#### Photography Tips
- **Lens**: At least 200mm, recommend 300mm+
- **Settings**: Shutter priority, 1/1000 second or higher (capture action)
- **Composition**: Low angle shots more powerful
- **Patience**: Lions may stay motionless for hours, but move quickly when active

### Interesting Facts

1. **Male Mane**: Darker color indicates higher testosterone, stronger fighting ability, more favored by females
2. **"Lion King" Misconception**: Male lions don't rule the pride, true core power lies with female elders
3. **Super Appetite**: An adult male can eat 40kg of meat at once (equivalent to 80 hamburgers)
4. **Laziest Champion**: Lions are the "laziest" of all big cats, active less than 4 hours daily
5. **Tongue Barbs**: Lion tongues are covered with keratin barbs, can lick meat off bones like a brush
